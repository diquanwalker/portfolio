John, by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justices, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his officials and loyal subjects, greeting.<p>
	
	Know that before God, for the health of our soul and those of our
	ancestors and heirs, to the honour of God, the exaltation of the holy
	Church, and the better ordering of our kingdom, at the advice of our
	reverend fathers Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all
	England, and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry archbishop of
	Dublin, William bishop of London, Peter bishop of Winchester, Jocelin
	bishop of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh bishop of Lincoln, Walter Bishop
	of Worcester, William bishop of Coventry, Benedict bishop of

	1. First, that we have granted to God, and by this present charter
	have confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity, that the English
	Church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished, and its
	liberties unimpaired. That we wish this so to be observed, appears
	from the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of the
	present dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by
	charter the freedom of the Church's elections - a right reckoned to be
	of the greatest necessity and importance to it - and caused this to be
	confirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe
	ourselves, and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in
	perpetuity. We have also granted to all free men of our realm, for us and
	our heirs for ever, all the liberties written out below, to have and
	to keep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs:
	<p>
	
	2. If any earl, baron, or other person that holds lands directly of
	the Crown, for military service, shall die, and at his death his heir
	shall be of full age and owe a `relief', the heir shall have his
	inheritance on payment of the ancient scale of `relief'. That is to
	say, the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay for the entire earl's barony, the heir or heirs of a knight l00s. at most for the
	entire knight's `fee', and any man that owes less shall pay less, in
	accordance with the ancient usage of `fees'<p>
	
	3. But if the heir of such a person is under age and a ward, when he
	comes of age he shall have his inheritance without `relief' or fine.
	
	<p>
	
	4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall take
	from it only reasonable revenues, customary dues, and feudal
	services. He shall do this without destruction or damage to men or
	property. If we have given the guardianship of the land to a sheriff,
	or to any person answerable to us for the revenues, and he commits
	destruction or damage, we will exact compensation from him, and the
	land shall be entrusted to two worthy and prudent men of the same
	`fee', who shall be answerable to us for the revenues, or to the
	person to whom we have assigned them. If we have given or sold to
	anyone the guardianship of such land, and he causes destruction or
	damage, he shall lose the guardianship of it, and it shall be handed
	over to two worthy and prudent men of the same `fee', who shall be
	similarly answerable to us.
	
	<p>
	
	5. For so long as a guardian has guardianship of such land, he shall
	maintain the houses, parks, fish preserves, ponds, mills, and
	everything else pertaining to it, from the revenues of the land
	itself. When the heir comes of age, he shall restore the whole land to
	him, stocked with plough teams and such implements of husbandry as the
	season demands and the revenues from the land can reasonably bear.
	
	<p>
	
	6. Heirs may be given in marriage, but not to someone of lower social
	standing. Before a marriage takes place, it shall be' made known to
	the heir's next-of-kin.
	
	<p>
	
	7. At her husband's death, a widow may have her marriage portion and
	inheritance at once and without trouble. She shall pay nothing for her
	dower, marriage portion, or any inheritance that she and her husband
	held jointly on the day of his death. She may remain in her husband's
	house for forty days after his death, and within this period her dower
	shall be assigned to her.<br>
	
	
	
	<p>
	
	8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes to
	remain without a husband. But she must give security that she will not
	marry without royal consent, if she holds her lands of the Crown, or
	without the consent of whatever other lord she may hold them of.
	
	<p>
	
	9. Neither we nor our officials will seize any land or rent in
	payment of a debt, so long as the debtor has movable goods sufficient
	to discharge the debt. A debtor's sureties shall not be distrained
	upon so long as the debtor himself can discharge his debt. If, for
	lack of means, the debtor is unable to discharge his debt, his
	sureties shall be answerable for it. If they so desire, they may have
	the debtor's lands and rents until they have received satisfaction for
	the debt that they paid for him, unless the debtor can show that he
	has settled his obligations to them.
	
	<p>
	
	10. If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies
	before the debt has been repaid, his heir shall pay no interest on the
	debt for so long as he remains under age, irrespective of whom he
	holds his lands. If such a debt falls into the hands of the Crown, it
	will take nothing except the principal sum specified in the bond.
	
	<p>
	<img src="/history/images/arms7.gif" align=right hspace=8>
	
	
	11. If a man dies owing money to Jews, his wife may have her dower
	and pay nothing towards the debt from it. If he leaves children that
	are under age, their needs may also be provided for on a scale
	appropriate to the size of his holding of lands. The debt is to be
	paid out of the residue, reserving the service due to his feudal
	lords. Debts owed to persons other than Jews are to be dealt with
	similarly.
	
	<p>
	
	12. No `scutage' or `aid' may be levied in our kingdom without its
	general consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to make
	our eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our eldest daughter. For
	these purposes ouly a reasonable `aid' may be levied. `Aids' from the
	city of London are to be treated similarly.
	
	<p>
	
	13. The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and
	free customs, both by land and by water. We also will and grant that
	all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall enjoy all their
	liberties and free customs.
	
	<p>
	
	14. To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment
	of an `aid' - except in the three cases specified above - or a `scutage',
	we will cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater
	barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those who hold lands
	directly of us we will cause a general summons to be issued, through
	the sheriffs and other officials, to come together on a fixed day (of
	which at least forty days notice shall be given) and at a fixed
	place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summons will be
	stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointed for the
	day shall go forward in accordance with the resolution of those
	present, even if not all those who were summoned have appeared.
	
	<p>
	
	15. In future we will allow no one to levy an `aid' from his free
	men, except to ransom his person, to make his eldest son a knight, and
	(once) to marry his eldest daughter. For these purposes only a
	reasonable `aid' may be levied.
	
	<p>
	
	16. No man shall be forced to perform more service for a knight's
	`fee', or other free holding of land, than is due from it.
	
	<p>
	
	17. Ordinary lawsuits shall not follow the royal court around, but
	shall be held in a fixed place.
	
	<p>
	
	18. Inquests of <I>novel disseisin</I>, <I>mort d'ancestor</I>, and
	<I>darrein presentment</I> shall be taken only in their proper county
	court. We ourselves, or in our absence abroad our chief justice, will
	send two justices to each county four times a year, and these
	justices, with four knights of the county elected by the county
	itself, shall hold the assizes in the county court, on the day and in
	the place where the court meets.
	
	<p>
	
	
	19. If any assizes cannot be taken on the day of the county court, as
	many knights and freeholders shall afterwards remain behind, of those
	who have attended the court, as will suffice for the administration
	of justice, having regard to the volume of business to be done.
	
	
	<p>
	
	20. For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in
	proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence
	correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his
	livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his
	merchandise, and a husbandman the implements of his husbandry, if they
	fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be
	imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the
	neighbourhood.
	
	<p>
	<img src="/history/images/arms3.gif" align=right hspace=8 width=50 height=80>
	
	
	21. Earls and barons shall not be amerced save through their peers, 
	
	and only according to the measure of the offence.
	
	<p>
	
	22. No clerk shall be amerced for his lay tenement ecept according to
	
	the manner of the other persons aforesaid; and not according to the 
	
	amount of his ecclesiastical benefice.
	
	<p>
	
	23. Neither a town nor a man shall be forced to make bridges over the
	
	rivers, with the exception of those who, from of old and of right 
	
	ought to do it.
	
	<p>
	
	24. No sheriff, constable, coroners, or other bailiffs of ours shall 
	
	hold the pleas of our crown.
	
	<p>
	
	25. All counties, hundreds, wapentakes, and trithings--our demesne 
	
	manors being exccepted--shall continue according to the old farms, 
	
	without any increase at all.
	
	<p>
	
	26. If any one holding from us a lay fee shall die, and our sheriff 
	
	or bailiff can show our letters patent containing our summons for 
	
	the debt which the dead man owed to us,--our sheriff or bailiff may
	
	be allowed to attach and enroll the chattels of the dead man to the 
	
	value of that debt, through view of lawful men; in such way, however, 
	
	that nothing shall be removed thence until the debt is paid which was 
	
	plainly owed to us. And the residue shall be left to the executors 
	
	that they may carry out the will of the dead man. And if nothing is 
	
	owed to us by him, all the chattels shall go to the use prescribed by 
	
	the deceased, saving their reasonable portions to his wife and 
	
	children.
	
	<p>
	
	27. If any freeman shall have died intestate his chattels shall be
	
	distributed through the hands of his near relatives and friends, by 
	
	view of the church; saving to any one the debts which the dead man 
	
	owed him.
	
	<p>
	
	28. No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take the corn or other 
	
	chattels of any one except he straightway give money for them, or can 
	
	be allowed a respite in that regard by the will of the seller.
	
	<p>
	
	29. No constable shall force any knight to pay money for castleward 
	
	if he be willing to perform that ward in person, or--he for a 
	
	reasonable cause not being able to perform it himself--through 
	
	another proper man. And if we shall have led or sent him on a 
	
	military expedition, he shall be quit of ward according to the 
	
	amount of time during which, through us, he shall have been in 
	
	military service.
	
	<p>
	
	30. No sheriff nor bailiff of ours, nor any one else, shall take the 
	
	horses or carts of any freeman for transport, unless by the will of 
	
	that freeman.
	
	<p><img src="/history/images/arms4.gif" align=right hspace=8 width=53 height=75>
	
	31. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall take another's wood for 
	
	castles or for other private uses, unless by the will of him to 
	
	whom the wood belongs.
	
	<p>
	
	32. We shall not hold the lands of those convicted of felony longer 
	
	than a year and a day; and then the lands shall be restored to the 
	
	lords of the fiefs.
	
	<p>
	
	33. Henceforth all the weirs in the Thames and Medway, and throughout 
	
	all England, save on the sea-coast, shall be done away with entirely.
	
	<p>
	
	
	34. Henceforth the writ which is called Praecipe shall not be to 
	
	served on any one for any holding so as to cause a free man to lose 
	
	his court.
	
	<p>
	
	35. There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, 
	
	and one measure of ale and one measure of corn--namely, the London 
	
	quart;--and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths--namely, 
	
	two ells below the selvage. And with weights, moreover, it shall be 
	
	as with measures. 
	
	<p>
	
	36. Henceforth nothing shall be given or taken for a writ of 
	
	inquest in a matter concerning life or limb; but it shall be 
	
	conceded gratis, and shall not be denied.
	
	<p>
	
	37. If any one hold of us in fee-farm, or in socage, or in burkage, 
	
	and hold land of another by military service, we shall not, by 
	
	reason of that fee-farm, or socage, or burkage, have the wardship 
	
	of his heir or of his land which is held in fee from another. Nor 
	
	shall we have the wardship of that fee-farm, or socage, or burkage 
	
	unless that fee-farm owe military service. We shall not, by reason 
	
	of some petit-serjeanty which some one holds of us through the 
	
	service of giving us knives or arrows or the like, have the wardship 
	
	of his heir or of the land which he holds of another by military 
	
	service.
	
	<p>
	
	38. No bailiff, on his own simple assertion, shall henceforth any 
	
	one to his law, without producing faithful witnesses in evidence.
	
	<p>
	
	39. No freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized, or 
	
	outlawed, or exiled, or in any way harmed--nor will we go upon or 
	
	send upon him--save by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the 
	
	law of the land.
	
	<p>
	
	40. To none will we sell, to none deny or delay, right or justice.
	
	<p>
	<img src="/history/images/arms5.gif" align=right hspace=8>
	
	41. All merchants may safely and securely go out of England, and come 
	
	into England, and delay and pass through England, as well by land as 
	
	by water, for the purpose of buying and selling, free from all evil 
	
	taxes, subject to the ancient and right customs--save in time of war,
	
	and if they are of the land at war against us. And if such be found 
	
	in our land at the beginning of the war, they shall be held, without 
	
	harm to their bodies and goods, until it shall be known to us or our 
	
	chief justice how the merchants of our land are to be treated who 
	
	shall, at that time, be found in the land at war against us. And if 
	
	ours shall be safe there, the others shall be safe in our land.
	
	<p>
	
	42. Henceforth any person, saving fealty to us, may go out of our 
	
	realm and return to it, safely and securely, by land and by water, 
	
	except perhaps for a brief period in time of war, for the common 
	
	good of the realm. But prisoners and outlaws are excepted according 
	
	to the law of the realm; also people of a land at war against us, 
	
	and the merchants, with regard to whom shall be done as we have said.
	
	<p>
	
	43. If any one hold from any escheat--as from the honour of Walingford, 
	
	Nottingham, Boloin, Lancaster, or the other escheats which are in our 
	
	hands and are baronies--and shall die, his heir shall not give another 
	
	relief, nor shall he perform for us other service than he would perform 
	
	for a baron if that barony were in the hand of a baron; and we shall 
	
	hold it in the same way in which the baron has held it. 
	
	<p>
	
	44. Persons dwelling without the forest shall not henceforth come 
	
	before the forest justices, through common summonses, unless they 
	
	are impleaded or are the sponsors of some person or persons attached 
	
	for matters concerning the forest.
	
	<p>
	
	45. We will not make men justices, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs 
	
	unless they are such as know the law of the realm, and are minded to 
	
	observe it rightly.
	
	<p>
	
	46. All barons who have founded abbeys for which they have charters 
	
	of the king of England, or ancient right of tenure, shall have, as 
	
	they ought to have, their custody when vacant.
	
	<p>
	
	47- A11 forests constituted as such in our time shall straightway be 
	
	annulled; and the same shall be done for river banks made into places 
	
	of defence by us in our time.
	
	<p>
	
	48. A11 evil customs concerning forests and warrens, and concerning 
	
	foresters and warreners, sheriffs and their servants, river banks 
	
	and their guardians, shall straightway be inquired into each county, 
	
	through twelve sworn knights from that county, and shall be 
	
	eradicated by them, entirely, so that they shall never be renewed, 
	
	within forty days after the inquest has been made; in such manner 
	
	that we shall first know about them, or our justice if we be not in 
	
	England.
	
	<p>
	
	49. We shall straightway return all hostages and charters which were 
	
	delivered to us by Englishmen as a surety for peace or faithful 
	
	service.
	
	<p>
	
	50. We shall entirey remove from their bailwicks the relatives of 
	
	Gerard de Athyes, so that they shall henceforth have no bailwick in 
	
	England: Engelard de Cygnes, Andrew Peter and Gyon de Chanceles, 
	
	Gyon de Cygnes, Geoffrey de Martin and his brothers, Philip Mark 
	
	and his brothers, and Geoffrey his nephew, and the whole following 
	
	of them.
	
	<p><img src="/history/images/arms6.gif" align=right hspace=8>
	
	51. And straightway after peace is restored we shall remove from
	
	the realm all the foreign soldiers, crossbowmen, servants, hirelings,
	
	who may have come with horses and arms to the harm of the realm. 
	
	<p>
	
	
	
	52. If any one shall have been disseized by us, or removed, without a 
	
	legal sentence of his peers, from his lands, castles, liberties or 
	
	lawful right, we shall straightway restore them to him. And if a 
	
	dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled 
	
	according to the judgment of the twenty-five barons who are mentioned
	
	below as sureties for the peace. But with regard to all those things
	
	of which any one was, by king Henry our father or king Richard our 
	
	brother, disseized or dispossessed without legal judgment of his 
	
	peers, which we have in our hand or which others hold, and for which 
	
	we ought to give a guarantee: We shall have respite until the common 
	
	term for crusaders. Except with regard to those concerning which a 
	
	plea was moved, or an inquest made by our order, before we took the 
	
	cross. But when we return from our pilgrimage, or if, by chance, we 
	
	desist from our pilgrimage, we shall straightway then show full 
	
	justice regarding them.
	
	<p>
	
	53. We shall have the same respite, moreover, and in the same manner, 
	
	in the matter of showing justice with regard to forests to be 
	
	annulled and forests to remain, which Henry our father or Richard 
	
	our brother constituted; and in the matter of wardships of lands 
	
	which belong to the fee of another--wardships of which kind we have 
	
	hitherto enjoyed by reason of the fee which some one held from us in 
	
	military service;--and in the matter of abbeys founded in the fee of
	
	another than ourselves--in which the lord of the fee may say that
	
	he has jurisdiction. And when we return, or if we desist from our 
	
	pilgrimage, we shall straightway exhibit full justice to those 
	
	complaining with regard to these matters.
	
	<p>
	
	54. No one shall be taken or imprisoned on account of the appeal of a 
	
	woman concerning the death of another than her husband.
	
	<p>
	
	55. All fines imposed by us unjustly and contrary to the law of the 
	
	land, and all amerciaments made unjustly and contrary to the law of 
	
	the land, shall be altogether remitted, or it shall be done with 
	
	regard to them according to the judgment of the twenty five barons 
	
	mentioned below as sureties for the peace, or according to the 
	
	judgment of the majority of them together with the aforesaid 
	
	Stephen archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and with 
	
	others whom he may wish to associate with himself for this purpose. 
	
	And if he can not be present, the affair shall nevertheless proceed 
	
	without him; in such way that, if one or more of the said twenty 
	
	five barons shall be concerned in a similar complaint, they shall 
	
	be removed as to this particular decision, and, in their place, 
	
	for this purpose alone, others shall be subtituted who shall be 
	
	chosen and sworn by the remainder of those twenty five.
	
	<p>
	
	56. If we have disseized or dispossessed Welshmen of their lands
	
	or liberties or other things without legal judgment of their peers, 
	
	in England or in Wales,--they shall straightway be restored to them. 
	
	And if a dispute shall arise concerning this, then action shall be
	
	taken upon it in the March through judgment of their peers-
	
	-concerning English holdings according to the law of England, 
	
	concerning Welsh holdings according to the law of Wales, concerning 
	
	holdings in the March according to the law of the March. The Welsh 
	
	shall do likewise with regard to us and our subjects.
	
	<p>
	
	57. But with regard to all those things of which any one of the Welsh 
	
	by king Henry our father or king Richard our brother, disseized or 
	
	dispossessed without legal judgment of his peers, which we have in 
	
	our hand or which others hold, and for which we ought to give a 
	
	guarantee: we shall have respite until the common term for crusaders. 
	
	Except with regard to those concerning which a plea was moved, or an 
	
	inquest made by our order, before we took the cross. But when we 
	
	return from our pilgrimage, or if, by chance, we desist from our 
	
	pilgrimage, we shall straightway then show full justice regarding 
	
	them, according to the laws of Wales and the aforesaid districts.
	
	<p>
	
	58. We shall straightway return the son of Llewelin and all the 
	
	Welsh hostages, and the charters delivered to us as surety for 
	
	the peace.
	
	<p>
	
	59. We shall act towards Alexander king of the Scots regarding 
	
	the restoration of his sisters, and his hostages, and his liberties 
	
	
	and his lawful right, as we shall act towards our other barons of 
	
	England; unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charters 
	
	which we hold from William, his father, the former king of the 
	
	Scots. And this shall be done through judgment of his peers in 
	
	our court.
	
	<p>
	
	60. Moreover all the subjects of our realm, clergy as well as 
	
	laity, shall, as far as pertains to them, observe, with regard
	
	to their vassals, all these aforesaid customs and liberties which 
	
	we have decreed shall, as far as pertains to us, be observed in 
	
	our realm with regard to our own.
	
	<p><img src="/history/images/arms2.gif" align=right hspace=8>
	
	61. Inasmuch as, for the sake of God, and for the bettering of our 
	
	realm, and for the more ready healing of the discord which has 
	
	arisen between us and our barons, we have made all these aforesaid 
	
	concessions,--wishing them to enjoy for ever entire and firm 
	
	stability, we make and grant to them the folIowing security: that
	
	the baron, namely, may elect at their pleaure twenty five barons 
	
	from the realm, who ought, with all their strength, to observe, 
	
	maintain and cause to be observed, the peace and privileges which 
	
	we have granted to them and confirmed by this our present charter. 
	
	In such wise, namely, that if we, or our justice, or our bailiffs, 
	
	or any one of our servants shall have transgressed against any one 
	
	in any respect, or shall have broken one of the articles of peace 
	
	or security, and our transgression shall have been shown to four 
	
	barons of the aforesaid twenty five: those four barons shall come 
	
	to us, or, if we are abroad, to our justice, showing to us our 
	
	error; and they shall ask us to cause that error to be amended 
	
	without delay. And if we do not amend that error, or, we being 
	
	abroad, if our justice do not amend it within a term of forty 
	
	days from the time when it was shown to us or, we being abroad, 
	
	to our justice: the aforesaid four barons shall refer the matter 
	
	to the remainder of the twenty five barons, and those twenty five 
	
	barons, with the whole land in common, shall distrain and oppress 
	
	us in every way in their power,--namely, by taking our castles, 
	
	lands and possessions, and in every other way that they can, until 
	
	amends shall have been made according to their judnnent. Saving 
	
	the persons of ourselves, our queen and our children. And when 
	
	amends shall have been made they shall be in accord with us as 
	
	they had been previously. And whoever of the land wishes to do 
	
	so, shall swear that in carrying out all the aforesaid measures he 
	
	will obey the mandates of the aforesaid twenty five barons, and that, 
	
	with them, he will oppress us to the extent of his power. And, to 
	
	any one who wishes to do so, we publicly and freely give permission 
	
	to swear; and we will never prevent any one from swearing. Moreover, 
	
	all those in the land who shall be unwilling, themselves and of their 
	
	own accord, to swear to the twenty five barons as to distraining and 
	
	oppressing us with them: such ones we shall make to wear by our
	
	mandate, as has been said. And if any one of the twenty five barons 
	
	shall die, or leave the country, or in any other way be prevented 
	
	from carrying out the aforesaid measures,--the remainder of the 
	
	aforesaid twenty five barons shall choose another in his place, 
	
	according to their judgment, who shall be sworn in the same way 
	
	as the others. Moreover, in all things entrusted to those twenty 
	
	five barons to be carried out, if those twenty five shall be present 
	
	and chance to disagree among themselves with regard to some matter, 
	
	or if some of them, having been summoned, shall be unwilling or 
	
	unable to be present: that which the majority of those present 
	
	shall decide or decree shall be considered binding and valid, just 
	
	as if all the twenty five had consented to it. And the aforesaid 
	
	twenty five shall swear that they will faithfully observe all the 
	
	foregoing, and will caue them be observed to the extent of their 
	
	power. And we shall obtain nothing from any one, either through 
	
	ourselves or through another, by which any of those concessions and 
	
	liberties may be revoked or diminished. And if any such thing shall 
	
	have been obtained, it shall be vain and invalid, and we shall never 
	
	make use of it either through ourselves or through another.
	
	<p>
	
	62. And we have fully remitted to all, and pardoned, all the ill-
	
	will, anger and rancour which have arisen between us and our 
	
	subjects, clergy and laity, from the time of the struggle. Moreover 
	
	have fully remitted to all, clergy and laity, and--as far as pertains 
	
	to us--have pardoned fully all the transgressions committed, on 
	
	the occasion of that same struggle, from Easter of the sixteenth 
	
	year of our reign until the re-establishment of peace. In witness 
	
	of which, more-over, we have caused to be drawn up for them letters 
	
	patent of lord Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, lord Henry, 
	
	archbishop of Dubland the aforesaid bishops and master Pandulf, 
	
	regarding that surety and the aforesaid concessions.
	
	<p>
	
	63. Wherefore we will and firmly decree that the English church 
	
	shall be free, and that the subjects of our realm shall have and 
	
	hold all the aforesaid liberties, rights and concessions, duly 
	
	and in peace, freely and quietly, fully and entirely, for 
	
	themselves and their heirs from us and our heirs, in all 
	
	matters and in all places, forever, as has been said. Moreover
	
	it has been sworn, on our part as well as on the part of the barons, 
	
	that all these above mentioned provisions shall observed with good 
	
	faith and without evil intent. The witnesses being the above
	
	mentioned and many others. Given through our hand, in the plain 
	
	called Runnymede between Windsor and Stanes, on the fifteenth day 
	
	of June, in the seventeenth year of our reign.<br><br>
