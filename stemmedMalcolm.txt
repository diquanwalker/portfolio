when
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
me

she
told
me
later

a
parti
of
hood

rider
gallop
up
to
our
home
in
omaha

nebraska

one
night

surround
the
hous

brandish
their
shotgun
and
rifl

they
shout
for
my
father
to
come
out

my
mother
went
to
the
front
door
and
open
it

stand
where
they
could
see
her
pregnant
condit

she
told
them
that
she
was
alon
with
her
three
small
children

and
that
my
father
was
away

preach

in
milwauke

the
klansmen
shout
threat
and
warn
at
her
that
we
had
better
get
out
of
town
becaus

the
good
christian
white
peopl

were
not
go
to
stand
for
my
father
s

spread
troubl

among
the

good

negro
of
omaha
with
the

back
to
africa

preach
of
marcus
garvey

my
father

the
reverend
earl
littl

was
a
baptist
minist

a
dedic
organ
for
marcus
aurelius
garvey
s
u
n
i
a


univers
negro
improvement
associat


with
the
help
of
such
discipl
as
my
father

garvey

from
his
headquart
in
new
york
citi
s
harlem

was
rais
the
banner
of
black
race
puriti
and
exhort
the
negro
mass
to
return
to
their
ancestr
african
homeland
a
caus
which
had
made
garvey
the
most
controversi
black
man
on
earth

still
shout
threat

the
klansmen
final
spur
their
hors
and
gallop
around
the
hous

shatter
everi
window
pane
with
their
gun
butt

then
they
rode
off
into
the
night

their
torch
flare

as
sudden
as
they
had
come

my
father
was
enrag
when
he
return

he
decid
to
wait
until
i
was
born
which
would
be
soon
and
then
the
famili
would
move

i
am
not
sure
whi
he
made
this
decis

for
he
was
not
a
frighten
negro

as
most
then
were

and
mani
still
are
today

my
father
was
a
big

six
foot
four

veri
black
man

he
had
onli
one
eye

how
he
had
lost
the
other
one
i
have
never
known

he
was
from
reynold

georgia

where
he
had
left
school
after
the
third
or
mayb
fourth
grade

he
believ

as
did
marcus
garvey

that
freedom

independ
and
self
respect
could
never
be
achiev
by
the
negro
in
america

and
that
therefor
the
negro
should
leav
america
to
the
white
man
and
return
to
his
african
land
of
origin

among
the
reason
my
father
had
decid
to
risk
and
dedic
his
life
to
help
dissemin
this
philosophi
among
his
peopl
was
that
he
had
seen
four
of
his
six
brother
die
by
violenc

three
of
them
kill
by
white
men

includ
one
by
lynch

what
my
father
could
not
know
then
was
that
of
the
remain
three

includ
himself

onli
one

my
uncle
jim

would
die
in
bed

of
natur
caus

northern
white
polic
were
later
to
shoot
my
uncle
oscar

and
my
father
was
final
himself
to
die
by
the
white
man
s
hand

it
has
alway
been
my
belief
that
i

too

will
die
by
violenc

i
have
done
all
that
i
can
to
be
prepar

was
actual

we
were
lung
and
bump
and
tumbl
all
over
each
other

escap

my

with
the
babi
in
her
arm

just
made

yell
our
head
off

the
white
polic
and
firemen
came
and
stood
around
watch
as
the
hous
burn
down
to
the
ground

my
father
prevail
on
some
friend
to
cloth
and
hous
us
temporarili

then
he
move
us
into
anoth
hous
on
the
outskirt
of
east

in
those
day
negro
weren
t
allow
after
dark
in
east
lans
proper

there
s
where
michigan
state
univers
is
locat

i
relat
all
of
this
to
an
audienc
of
student
when
i
spoke
there
in
januari

1963

and
had
the
first
reunion
in
a
long
while
with
my
younger
brother

robert

who
was
there
do
postgradu
studi
in
psycholog


i
told
them
how
east
lans
harass
us
so
much
that
we
had
to
move
again

this
time
two
mile
out
of
town

into
the
countri

this
was
where
my
father
built
for
us
with
his
own
hand
a
four
room
hous

this
is
where
i
realli
begin
to
rememb
thing
this
home
where
i
start
to
grow
up

after
the
fire

i
rememb
that
my
father
was
call
in
and
question
about
a
permit
for
the
pistol
with
which
he
had
shot
at
the
white
men
who
set
the
fire

i
rememb
that
the
polic
were
alway
drop
by
our
hous

shove
thing
around


just
check

or

look
for
a
gun


the
pistol
they
were
look
for
which
they
never
found

and
for
which
they
wouldn
t
issu
a
permit
was
sew
up
insid
a
pillow

my
father
s

22
rifl
and
his
shotgun

though

were
right
out
in
the
open

everyon
had
them
for
hunt
bird
and
rabbit
and
other
game







after
that

my
memori
are
of
the
friction
between
my
father
and
mother

they
seem
to
be
near
alway
at
odd

sometim
my
father
would
beat
her

it
might
have
had
someth
to
do
with
the
fact
that
my
mother
had
a
pretti
good
educ

where
she
got
it
i
don
t
know

but
an
educ
woman

i
suppos

can
t
resist
the
temptat
to
correct
an
uneduc
man

everi
now
and
then

when
she
put
those
smooth
word
on
him

he
would
grab
her

my
father
was
also
belliger
toward
all
of
the
children

except
me

the
older
one
he
would
beat
almost
savag
if
they
broke
ani
of
his
rule
and
he
had
so
mani
rule
it
was
hard
to
know
them
all

near
all
my
whip
came
from
my
mother

i
ve
thought
a
lot
about
whi

i
actual
believ
that
as
anti
white
as
my
father
was

he
was
subconsci
so
afflict
with
the
white
man
s
brainwash
of
negro
that
he
inclin
to
favor
the
light
one

and
i
was
his
lightest
child

most
negro
parent
in
those
day
would
almost
instinct
treat
ani
lighter
children
better
than
they
did
the
darker
one

it
came
direct
from
the
slaveri
tradit
that
the

mulatto


becaus
he
was
visibl
nearer
to
white

was
therefor

better


my
two
other
imag
of
my
father
are
both
outsid
the
home

one
was
his
role
as
a
baptist
preacher

he
never
pastor
in
ani
regular
church
of
his
own

he
was
alway
a

visit
preacher


i
rememb
especi
his
favorit
sermon


that
littl
_black_
train
is
a
comin







an

you
better
get
all
your
busi
right


i
guess
this
also
fit
his
associ
with
the
back
to
africa
movement

with
marcus
garvey
s

black
train
homeward


my
brother
philbert

the
one
just
older
than
me

love
church

but
it
confus
and
amaz
me

i
would
sit
goggl
eye
at
my
father
jump
and
shout
as
he
preach

with
the
congreg
jump
and
shout
behind
him

their
soul
and
bodi
devot
to
sing
and
pray

even
at
that
young
age

i
just
couldn
t
believ
in
the
christian
concept
of
jesus
as
someon
divin

and
no
religi
person

until
i
was
a
man
in
my
twenti
and
then
in
prison
could
tell
me
anyth

i
had
veri
littl
respect
for
most
peopl
who
repres
religion

it
was
in
his
role
as
a
preacher
that
my
father
had
most
contact
with
the
negro
of
lans

believ
me
when
i
tell
you
that
those
negro
were
in
bad
shape
then

they
are
still
in
bad
shape
though
in
a
differ
way

by
that
i
mean
that
i
don
t
know
a
town
with
a
higher
percentag
of
complac
and
misguid
so
call

middl
class

negro
the
typic
status
symbolori

integr
seek
type
of

just
recent

i
was
stand
in
a
lobbi
at
theunit
nation
talk
with
an
african
ambassador
and
his
wife

when
a
negro
came
up
to
me
and
said


you
know
me


i
was
a
littl
embarrass
becaus
i
thought
he
was
someon
i
should
rememb

it
turn
out
that
he
was
one
of
those
brag

self
satisfi


middl
class

lans
negro

i
wasn
t
ingrati

he
was
the
type
who
would
never
have
been
associ
with
africa

until
the
fad
of
have
african
friend
becam
a
status
symbol
for

middl
class

negro

back
when
i
was
grow
up

the

success

lans
negro
were
such
as
waiter
and
bootblack

to
be
a
janitor
at
some
downtown
store
was
to
be
high
respect

the
real

elit


the

big
shot


the

voic
of
the
race


were
the
waiter
at
the
lans
countri
club
and
the
shoeshin
boy
at
the
state
capitol

the
onli
negro
who
realli
had
ani
money
were
the
one
in
the
number
racket

or
who
ran
the
gambl
hous

or
who
in
some
other
way
live
parasit
off
the
poorest
one

who
were
the
mass

no
negro
were
hire
then
by
lans
s
big
oldsmobil
plant

or
the
reo
plant


do
you
rememb
the
reo

it
was
manufactur
in
lans

and
r

e

olds

the
man
after
whom
it
was
name

also
live
in
lans

when
the
war
came
along

they
hire
some
negro
janitor


the
bulk
of
the
negro
were
either
on
welfar

or
w
p
a


or
they
starv

the
day
was
to
come
when
our
famili
was
so
poor
that
we
would
eat
the
hole
out
of
a
doughnut

but
at
that
time
we
were
much
better
off
than
most
town
negro

the
reason
was
that
we
rais
much
of
our
own
food
out
there
in
the
countri
where
we
were

we
were
much
better
off
than
the
town
negro
who
would
shout

as
my
father
preach

for
the
pie
in
the
sky
and
their
heaven
in
the
hereaft
while
the
white
man
had
his
here
on
earth

i
knew
that
the
collect
my
father
got
for
his
preach
were
main
what
fed
and
cloth
us

and
he
also
did
other
odd
job

but
still
the
imag
of
him
that
made
me
proudest
was
his
crusad
and
milit
campaign
with
theword
of
marcus
garvey

as
young
as
i
was
then

i
knew
from
what
i
overheard
that
my
father
was
say
someth
that
made
him
a

tough

man

i
rememb
an
old
ladi

grin
and
say
to
my
father


you
re
scare
these
white
folk
to
death


one
of
the
reason
i
ve
alway
felt
that
my
father
favor
me
was
that
to
the
best
of
my
remembr

it
was
onli
me
that
he
sometim
took
with
him
to
the
garvey
u
n
i
a

meet
which
he
held
quiet
in
differ
peopl
s
home

there
were
never
more
than
a
few
peopl
at
ani
one
time
twenti
at
most

but
that
was
a
lot

pack
into
someon
s
live
room

i
notic
how
differ
they
all
act

although
sometim
they
were
the
same
peopl
who
jump
and
shout
in
church

but
in
these
meet
both
they
and
my
father
were
more
intens

more
intellig
and
down
to
earth

it
made
me
feel
the
same
way

i
can
rememb
hear
of

adam
driven
out
of
the
garden
into
the
cave
of
europ



africa
for
the
african



ethiopian

awake


and
my
father
would
talk
about
how
it
would
not
be
much
longer
befor
africa
would
be
complet
run
by
negro

by
black
men


was
the
phrase
he
alway
use


no
one
know
when
the
hour
of
africa
s
redempt
cometh

it
is
in
the
wind

it
is
come

one
day

like
a
storm

it
will
be
here


i
rememb
see
the
big

shini
photograph
of
marcus
garvey
that
were
pass
from
hand
to
hand

my
father
had
a
big
envelop
of
them
that
he
alway
took
to
these
meet

the
pictur
show
what
seem
to
me
million
of
negro
throng
in
parad
behind
garvey
ride
in
a
fine
car

a
big
black
man
dress
in
a
dazzl
uniform
with
gold
braid
on
it

and
he
was
wear
a
thrill
hat
with
tall
plume

i
rememb
hear
that
he
had
black
follow
not
onli
hi
the
unite
state
but
all
around
the
world

and
i
rememb
how
the
meet
alway
close
with
my
father
say

sever
time

and
the
peopl
chant
after
him


up

you
mighti
race

you
can
accomplish
what
you
will


i
have
never
understood
whi

after
hear
as
much
as
i
did
of
these
kind
of
thing

i
somehow
never
thought

then

of
the
black
peopl
in
africa

my
imag
of
africa

at
that
time

was
of
nake
savag

cannib

monkey
and
tiger
and
steam
jungl

my
father
would
drive
in
his
old
black
tour
car

sometim
take
me

to
meet
place
all
around
the
lans
area

i
rememb
one
daytim
meet

most
were
at
night

in
the
town
of
owosso

forti
mile
from
lans

which
the
negro
call

white
citi



owosso
s
greatest
claim
to
fame
is
that
it
is
the
home
town
of
thoma
e

dewey


as
in
east
lans

no
negro
were
allow
on
the
street
there
after
dark
henc
the
daytim
meet

in
point
of
fact

in
those
day
lot
of
michigan
town
were
like
that

everi
town
had
a
few

home

negro
who
live
there

sometim
it
would
be
just
one
famili

as
in
the
nearbi
counti
seat

mason

which
had
a
singl
negro
famili
name
lyon

mr

lyon
had
been
a
famous
footbal
star
at
mason
high
school

was
high
thought
of
in
mason

and
consequ
he
now
work
around
that
town
in
menial
job

my
mother
at
this
tune
seem
to
be
alway
work
cook

wash

iron

clean

and
fuss
over
us
eight
children

and
she
was
usual
either
argu
with
or
not
speak
to
my
father

one
caus
of
friction
was
that
she
had
strong
idea
about
what
she
wouldn
t
eat
and
didn
t
want
_us_
to
eat
includ
pork
and
rabbit

both
of
which
my
father
love
dear

he
was
a
real
georgia
negro

and
he
believ
in
eat
plenti
of
what
we
in
harlem
today
call

soul
food


i
ve
said
that
my
mother
was
the
one
who
whip
me
at
least
she
did
whenev
she
wasn
t
asham
to
let
the
neighbor
think
she
was
kill
me

for
if
she
even
act
as
though
she
was
about
to
rais
her
hand
to
me

i
would
openmi
mouth
and
let
the
world
know
about
it

if
anybodi
was
pass
by
out
on
the
road

she
would
either
chang
her
mind
or
just
give
me
a
few
lick

think
about
it
now

i
feel
definit
that
just
as
my
father
favor
me
for
be
lighter
than
the
other
children

my
mother
gave
me
more
hell
for
the
same
reason

she
was
veri
light
herself
but
she
favor
the
one
who
were
darker

wilfr

i
know

was
particular
her
angel

i
rememb
that
she
would
tell
me
to
get
out
of
the
hous
and

let
the
sun
shine
on
you
so
you
can
get
some
color


she
went
out
of
her
way
never
to
let
me
becom
afflict
with
a
sens
of
color
superior

i
am
sure
that
she
treat
me
this
way
part
becaus
of
how
she
came
to
be
light
herself

i
learn
earli
that
cri
out
in
protest
could
accomplish
thing

my
older
brother
and
sister
had
start
to
school
when

sometim

they
would
come
in
and
ask
for
a
butter
biscuit
or
someth
and
my
mother

impati

would
tell
them
no

but
i
would
cri
out
and
make
a
fuss
until
i
got
what
i
want

i
rememb
well
how
my
mother
ask
me
whi
i
couldn
t
be
a
nice
boy
like
wilfr

but
i
would
think
to
myself
that
wilfr

for
be
so
nice
and
quiet

often
stay
hungri

so
earli
in
life

i
had
learn
that
if
you
want
someth

you
had
better
make
some
nois

not
onli
did
we
have
our
big
garden

but
we
rais
chicken

my
father
would
buy
some
babi
chick
and
my
mother
would
rais
them

we
all
love
chicken

that
was
one
dish
there
was
no
argument
with
my
father
about

one
thing
in
particular
that
i
rememb
made
me
feel
grate
toward
my
mother
was
that
one
day
i
went
and
ask
her
for
my
own
garden

and
she
did
let
me
have
my
own
littl
plot

i
love
it
and
took
care
of
it
well

i
love
especi
to
grow
pea

i
was
proud
when
we
had
them
on
our
tabl

i
would
pull
out
the
grass
in
my
garden
by
hand
when
the
first
littl
blade
came
up

i
would
patrol
the
row
on
my
hand
and
knee
for
ani
worm
and
bug

and
i
would
kill
and
buri
them

and
sometim
when
i
had
everyth
straight
and
clean
for
myth
to
grow

i
would
lie
down
on
my
back
between
two
row

and
i
would
gaze
up
in
the
blue
sky
at
the
cloud
move
and
think
all
kind
of
thing

at
five

i

too

began
to
go
to
school

leav
home
in
the
morn
along
with
wilfr

hilda

and
philbert

it
was
the
pleasant
grove
school
that
went
from
kindergarten
through
the
eighth
grade

it
was
two
mile
outsid
the
citi
limit

and
i
guess
there
was
no
problem
about
our
attend
becaus
we
were
the
onli
negro
in
the
area

in
those
day
white
peopl
in
the
north
usual
would

adopt

just
a
few
negro

they
didn
t
see
them
as
ani
threat

the
white
kid
didn
t
make
ani
great
thing
about
us

either

they
call
us

nigger

and

darki

and

rastus

so
much
that
we
thought
those
were
our
natur
name

but
they
didn
t
think
of
it
as
an
insult

it
was
just
the
way
they
thought
about
us







one
afternoon
in
1931
when
wilfr

hilda

philbert

and
i
came
home

my
mother
and
father
were
have
one
of
their
argument

there
had
late
been
a
lot
of
tension
around
the
hous
becaus
of
black
legion
threat

anyway

my
father
had
taken
one
of
the
rabbit
which
we
were
rais

and
order
my
mother
to
cook
it

we
rais
rabbit

but
sold
them
to
white

my
father
had
taken
a
rabbit
from
the
rabbit
pen

he
had
pull
off
the
rabbit
s
head

he
was
so
strong

he
need
no
knife
to
behead
chicken
or
rabbit

with
one
twist
of
his
big
black
hand
he
simpli
twist
off
the
head
and
threw
the
bleed
neck
thing
back
at
my
mother
s
feet

my
mother
was
cri

she
start
to
skin
the
rabbit

preparatori
to
cook
it

but
my
father
was
so
angri
he
slam
on
out
of
the
front
door
and
start
walk
up
the
road
toward
town

it
was
then
that
my
mother
had
this
vision

she
had
alway
been
a
strang
woman
in
this
sens

and
had
alway
had
a
strong
intuit
of
thing
about
to
happen

and
most
of
her
children
are
the
same
way

i
think

when
someth
is
about
to
happen

i
can
feel
someth

sens
someth

i
never
have
known
someth
to
happen
that
has
caught
me
complet
off
guard
except
onc

and
that
was
when

year
later

i
discov
fact
i
couldn
t
believ
about
a
man
who

up
until
that
discoveri

i
would
glad
have
given
my
life
for

my
father
was
well
up
the
road
when
my
mother
ran
scream
out
onto
the
porch

_
ear

ear

_
she
scream
his
name

she
clutch
up
her
apron
in
one
hand

and
ran
down
across
the
yard
and
into
the
road

my
father
turn
around

he
saw
her

for
some
reason

consid
how
angri
he
had
been
when
he
left

he
wave
at
her

but
he
kept
on
go

she
told
me
later

my
mother
did

that
she
had
a
vision
of
my
father
s
end

all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon

she
was
not
herself

cri
and
nervous
and
upset

she
finish
cook
the
rabbit
and
put
the
whole
thing
in
the
warmer
part
of
the
black
stove

when
my
father
was
not
back
home
by
our
bedtim

my
mother
hug
and
clutch
us

and
we
felt
strang

not
know
what
to
do

becaus
she
had
never
act
like
that

i
rememb
wake
up
to
the
sound
of
my
mother
s
scream
again

when
i
scrambl
out

i
saw
the
polic
in
the
irving
room

they
were
tri
to
calm
her
down

she
had
snatch
on
her
cloth
to
go

and
all
of
us
children
who
were
stare
knew
without
anyon
have
to
say
it
that
someth
terribl
had
happen
to
our
father

my
mother
was
taken
by
the
polic
to
the
hospit

and
to
a
room
where
a
sheet
was
over
my
father
in
a
bed

and
she
wouldn
t
look

she
was
afraid
to
look

probabl
it
was
wise
that
she
didn
t

my
father
s
skull

on
one
side

was
crush
in

i
was
told
later

almost
in

now

especi
georgia

negro
born
in

had
to
be
strong
simpli
to
surviv

it
was
morn
when

and
the

i
thought
that
it

and
i
wish
they
hadn

back
in

hous

there
were
mani
visitor

garvey
meet

we
children
adjust
more
easili
than
our

did

we
couldn
t
see

as
clear
as
she
did

the
trial
that
lay
ahead

as
the
visitor
taper
off

she
becam
veri
concern
about
collect
the
two
insur
polici
that
my
father
had
alway
been
proud
he
carri

he
had
alway
said
that
famili
should
be
protect
in
case
of
death

one
polici
appar
paid
off
without
ani
problemth
smaller
one

i
don
t
know
the
amount
of
it

i
would
imagin
it
was
not
more
than
a
thousand
dollar

and
mayb
half
of
that

but
after
that
money
came

and
my
mother
had
paid
out
a
lot
of
it
for
the
funer
and
expens

she
began
go
into
town
and
return
veri
upset

the
compani
that
had
issu
the
bigger
polici
was
balk
at
pay
off

they
were
claim
that
my
father
had
commit
suicid

visitor
came
again

and
there
was
bitter
talk
about
white
peopl

how
could
my
father
bash
himself
in
the
head

then
get
down
across
the
streetcar
track
to
be
run
over

so
there
we
were

my
mother
was
thirti
four
year
old
now

with
no

no
provid
or
protector
to
take
care
of

but
some
kind
of
a
famili
routin
got
go

and
for
as
long
as
the
first
insur
money
last

we
did
all
right

wilfr

who
was
a
pretti
stabl
fellow

began
to
act
older
than
his
age

i
think
he
had
the
sens
to
see

when
the
rest
of
us
didn
t

what
was
in
the
wind
for
us

he
quiet
quit
school
and
went
to
town
in
search
of
work

he
took
ani
kind
of
job
he
could
find
and
he
would
come
home

dog
tire

in
the
even

and
give
whatev
he
had
made
to
my
mother

hilda

who
alway
had
been
quiet

too

attend
to
the
babi

philbert
and
i
didn
t
contribut
anyth

we
just
fought
all
the
time
each
other
at
home

and
then
at
school
we
would
team
up
and
fight
white
kid

sometim
the
fight
would
be
racial
in
natur

but
they
might
be
about
anyth

reginald
came
under
my
wing

sinc
he
had
grown
out
of
the
toddl
stage

he
and
i
had
becom
veri
close

i
suppos
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
he
was
the
littl
one

under
me

who
look
up
to
me

my
mother
began
to
buy
on
credit

my
father
had
alway
been
veri
strong
against
credit


credit
is
the
first
step
into
debt
and
back
into
slaveri


he
had
alway
said

and
then
she
went
to
work
herself

she
would
go
into
lans
and
find
differ
job
in
housework

or
sew
for
white
peopl

they
didn
t
realiz

usual

that
she
was
a
negro

a
lot
of
white
peopl
around
there
didn
t
want
negro
in
their
hous

she
would
do
fine
until
in
some
way
or
other
it
got
to
peopl
who
she
was

whose
widow
she
was

and
then
she
would
be
let
go

i
rememb
how
she
use
to
come
home
cri

but
tri
to
hide
it

becaus
she
had
lost
a
job
that
she
need
so
much

once
when
one
of
us
i
cannot
rememb
which
had
to
go
for
someth
to
where
she
was
work

and
the
peopl
saw
us

and
realiz
she
was
actual
a
negro

she
was
fire
on
the
spot

and
she
came
home
cri

this
time
not
hide
it

when
the
state
welfar
peopl
began
come
to
our
hous

we
would
come
from
school
sometim
and
find
them

with
our
mother

ask
a
thousand
question

they
act
and
look
at
her

and
at
us

and
around
in
our
hous

in
a
way
that
had
about
it
the
feel
at
least
for
me
that
we
were
not
peopl

in
their
eyesight
we
were
just
_things_

that
was
all

my
mother
began
to
receiv
two
check
a
welfar
check
and

i
believ

widow
s
pension

the
check
help

but
they
weren
t
enough

as
mani
of
us
as
there
were

when
they
came

about
the
first
of
the
month

one
alway
wasalreadi
owe
in
full

if
not
more

to
the
man
at
the
groceri
store

and

after
that

the
other
one
didn
t
last
long

we
began
to
go
swift
downhil

the
physic
downhil
wasn
t
as
quick
as
the
psycholog

my
mother
was

abov
everyth
els

a
proud
woman

and
it
took
it
toll
on
her
that
she
was
accept
chariti

and
her
feel
were
communic
to
us

she
would
speak
sharpli
to
the
man
at
the
groceri
store
for
pad
the
bill

tell
him
that
she
wasn

and
he
didn

like
that

she
would
talk

welfar
peopl

tell
them
that
she
was

that
it
wasn

necessari
for
them
to
keep
come
around
so
much

meddl
in
our
live

and
they
didn
t
like
that

but
the
month
welfar

was
their
pass

they
act
as
if
they
own
us

as
if
we
were

as
much
as
my
mother
would
have
like
to

she
couldn

when
they
began

at
a
time

out
on

porch
or
somewher

and
ask

desper
effort
to
preserv
her
pride
and
our

pride
was
just
about
all
we
had
to
preserv

for
by
1934

we
realli
began
to
suffer

this
was
about
the
worst
depress
year

and
no
one
we
knew
had
enough
to
eat
or
live
on

some
old
famili
friend
visit
us
now
and
then

at
first
they
brought
food

though
it
was
chariti

my
mother
took
it

wilfr
was
work
to
help

my
mother
was
work

when
she
could
find
ani
kind
of
job

in
lans

there
was
a
bakeri
where

for
a
nickel

a
coupl
of
us
children
would
buy
a
tall
flour
sack
of
day
old
bread
and
cooki

and
then
walk
the
two
mile
back
out
into
the
countri
to
our
hous

our
mother
knew

i
guess

dozen
of
way
to
cook
thing
with
bread
and
out
of
bread

stew
tomato
with
bread

mayb
that
would
be
a
meal

someth
like
french
toast

if
we
had
ani
egg

bread
pud

sometim
with
raisin
in
it

if
we
got
hold
of
some
hamburg

it
came
to
the
tabl
more
bread
than
meat

the
cooki
that
were
alway
in
the
sack
with
the
bread

we
just
gobbl
down
straight

but
there
were
time
when
there
wasn
t
even
a
nickel
and
we
would
be
so
hungri
we
were
dizzi

my
mother
would
boil
a
big
pot
of
dandelion
green

and
we
would
eat
that

i
rememb
that
some
small
mind
neighbor
put
it
out

and
children
would
teas
us

that
we
ate

fri
grass


sometim

if
we
were
lucki

we
would
have
oatmeal
or
cornmeal
mush
three
time
a
day

or
mush
in
the
morn
and
cornbread
at
night

philbert
and
i
were
grown
up
enough
to
quit
fight
long
enough
to
take
the

22
calib
rifl
that
had
been
our
father
s

and
shoot
rabbit
that
some
white
neighbor
up
or
down
the
road
would
buy

i
know
now
that
they
just
did
it
to
help
us

becaus
they

like
everyon

shot
their
own
rabbit

sometim

i
rememb

philbert
and
i
would
take
littl
reginald
along
with
us

he
wasn
t
veri
strong

but
he
was
alway
so
proud
to
be
along

we
would
trap
muskrat
out
in
the
littl
creek
in
back
of
our
hous

and
we
would
lie
quiet
until
unsuspect
bullfrog
appear

and
we
would
spear
them

cut
off
their
leg

and
sell
them
for
a
nickel
a
pair
to
peopl
who
live
up
and
down
the
road

the
white
seem
less
restrict
in
their
dietari
tast

then

about
in
late
1934

i
would
guess

someth
began
to
happen

some
kind
of
psycholog
deterior
hit
our
famili
circl
and
began
to
eat
awayour
pride

perhap
it
was
the
constant
tangibl
evid
that
we
were
destitut

we
had
known
other
famili
who
had
gone
on
relief

we
had
known
without
anyon
in
our
home
ever
express
it
that
we
had
felt
prouder
not
to
be
at
the
depot
where
the
free
food
was
pass
out

and

now

we
were
among
them

at
school

the

on
relief

finger
sudden
was
point
at
us

too

and
sometim
it
was
said
aloud

it
seem
that
everyth
to
eat
in
our
hous
was
stamp
not
to
be
sold

all
welfar
food
bore
this
stamp
to
keep
the
recipi
from
sell
it

it
s
a
wonder
we
didn
t
come
to
think
of
not
to
be
sold
as
a
brand
name

sometim

instead
of
go
home
from
school

i
walk
the
two
mile
up
the
road
into
lans

i
began
drift
from
store
to
store

hang
around
outsid
where
thing
like
appl
were
display
in
box
and
barrel
and
basket

and
i
would
watch
my
chanc
and
steal
me
a
treat

you
know
what
a
treat
was
to
me

anyth

or
i
began
to
drop
in
about
dinnertim
at
the
home
of
some
famili
that
we
knew

i
knew
that
they
knew
exact
whi
i
was
there

but
they
never
embarrass
me
by
let
on

they
would
invit
me
to
stay
for
supper

and
i
would
stuff
myself

especial

i
like
to
drop
in
and
visit
at
the
gohannas

home

they
were
nice

older
peopl

and
great
churchgoer

i
had
watch
them
lead
the
jump
and
shout
when
my
father
preach

they
had

live
with
them
they
were
rais
him
a
nephew
whom
everyon
call

big
boy


and
he
and
i
got
along
fine

also
live
with
the
gohannas
was
old
mrs

adcock

who
went
with
them
to
church

she
was
alway
tri
to
help
anybodi
she
could

visit
anyon
she
heard
was
sick

carri
them
someth

she
was
the
one
who

year
later

would
tell
me
someth
that
i
rememb
a
long
time


malcolm
there
s
one
thing
i
like
about
you

you
re
no
good

but
you
don
t
tri
to
hide
it

you
are
not
a
hypocrit


the
more
i
began
to
stay
away
from
home
and
visit
peopl
and
steal
from
the
store

the
more
aggress
i
becam
in
my
inclin

i
never
want
to
wait
for
anyth

i
was
grow
up
fast

physic
more
so
than
mental

as
i
began
to
be
recogn
more
around
the
town

i
start
to
becom
awar
of
the
peculiar
attitud
of
white
peopl
toward
me

i
sens
that
it
had
to
do
with
my
father

it
was
an
adult
version
of
what
sever
white
children
had
said
at
school

in
hint

or
sometim
in
the
open

which
realli
express
what
their
parent
had
said
that
the
black
legion
or
the
klan
had
kill
my
father

and
the
insur
compani
had
pull
a
fast
one
in
refus
to
pay
my
mother
the
polici
money

when
i
began
to
get
caught
steal
now
and
then

the
state
welfar
peopl
began
to
focus
on
me
when
they
came
to
our
hous

i
can
t
rememb
how
i
first
becam
awar
that
they
were
talk
of
take
me
away

what
i
first
rememb
along
that
line
was
my
mother
rais
a
storm
about
be
abl
to
bring
up
her
own
children

she
would
whip
me
for
steal

and
i
would
tri
to
alarm
the
neighborhood
with
my
yell

one
thing
i
have
alway
been
proud
of
is
that
i
never
rais
my
hand
against
my
mother

in
the
summertim

at
night

in
addit
to
all
the
other
thing
we
did

some
of
us
boy
would
slip
out
down
the
road

or
across
the
pastur

and
go

coon

watermelon

white
peopl
alway
associ
watermelon
with
negro

and
they
sometim
call
negro

coon

among
all
the
other
name

and
so
steal
watermelon
becam

coon

them

if
white
boy
were
do
it

it
impli
that
they
were
onli
act
like
negro

white
have
alway
hidden
or
justifi
all
of
the
guilt
they
could
by
ridicul
or
blame
negro

one
halloween
night

i
rememb
that
a
bunch
of
us
were
out
tip
over
those
old
countri
outhous

and
one
old
farmer
i
guess
he
had
tip
over
enough
in
his
day
had
set
a
trap
for
us

alway

you
sneak
up
from
behind
the
outhous

then
you
gang
togeth
and
push
it

to
tip
it
over

this
farmer
had
taken
his
outhous
off
the
hole

and
set
it
just
in
_front_
of
the
hole

well

we
came
sneak
up
in
singl
file

in
the
dark

and
the
two
white
boy
in
the
lead
fell
down
into
the
outhous
hole
neck
deep

they
smell
so
bad
it
was
all
we
could
stand
to
get
them
out

and
that
finish
us
all
for
that
halloween

i
had
just
miss
fall
in
myself

the
white
were
so
use
to
take
the
lead

this
time
it
had
realli
gotten
them
in
the
hole

thus

in
various
way

i
learn
various
thing

i
pick
strawberri

and
though
i
can
t
recal
what
i
got
per
crate
for
pick

i
rememb
that
after
work
hard
all
one
day

i
wound
up
with
about
a
dollar

which
was
a
whole
lot
of
money
in
those
time

i
was
so
hungri

i
didn
t
know
what
to
do

i
was
walk
away
toward
town
with
vision
of
buy
someth
good
to
eat

and
this
older
white
boy
i
knew

richard
dixon

came
up
and
ask
me
if
i
want
to
match
nickel

he
had
plenti
of
chang
for
my
dollar

in
about
a
half
hour

he
had
all
the
chang
back

includ
my
dollar

and
instead
of
go
to
town
to
buy
someth

i
went
home
with
noth

and
i
was
bitter

but
that
was
noth
compar
to
what
i
felt
when
i
found
out
later
that
he
had
cheat

there
is
a
way
that
you
can
catch
and
hold
the
nickel
and
make
it
come
up
the
way
you
want

this
was
my
first
lesson
about
gambl

if
you
see
somebodi
win
all
the
time

he
isn
t
gambl

he
s
cheat

later
on
in
life

if
i
were
continu
lose
in
ani
gambl
situat

i
would
watch
veri
close

it
s
like
the
negro
in
america
see
the
white
man
win
all
the
time

he
s
a
profession
gambler

he
has
all
the
card
and
the
odd
stack
on
his
side

and
he
has
alway
dealt
to
our
peopl
from
the
bottom
of
the
deck

about
this
time

my
mother
began
to
be
visit
by
some
seventh
day
adventist
who
had
move
into
a
hous
not
too
far
down
the
road
from
us

theywould
talk
to
her
for
hour
at
a
time

and
leav
booklet
and
leaflet
and
magazin
for
her
to
read

she
read
them

and
wilfr

who
had
start
back
to
school
after
we
had
begun
to
get
the
relief
food
suppli

also
read
a
lot

his
head
was
forev
in
some
book

befor
long

my
mother
spent
much
time
with
the
adventist

it
s
my
belief
that
what
most
influenc
her
was
that
they
had
even
more
diet
restrict
than
she
alway
had
taught
and
practic
with
us

like
us

they
were
against
eat
rabbit
and
pork

they
follow
the
mosaic
dietari
law

they
ate
noth
of
the
flesh
without
a
split
hoof

or
that
didn
t
chew
a
cud

we
began
to
go
with
my
mother
to
the
adventist
meet
that
were
held
further
out
in
the
countri

for
us
children

i
know
that
the
major
attract
was
the
good
food
they
serv

but
we
listen

too

there
were
a
hand
of
negro

from
small
town
in
the
area

but
i
would
say
that
it
was
nineti
nine
percent
white
peopl

the
adventist
felt
that
we
were
live
at
the
end
of
time

that
the
world
soon
was
come
to
an
end

but
they
were
the
friendliest
white
peopl
i
had
ever
seen

in
some
way

though

we
children
notic

and

when
we
were
back
at
home

discuss

that
they
were
differ
from
us
such
as
the
lack
of
enough
season
in
their
food

and
the
differ
way
that
white
peopl
smell







meanwhil

the
state
welfar
peopl
kept
after
my
mother

by
now

she
didn
t
make
it
ani
secret
that
she
hate
them

and
didn
t
want
them
in
her
hous

but
they
exert
their
right
to
come

and
i
have
mani

mani
time
reflect
upon
how

talk
to
us
children

they
began
to
plant
the
seed
of
divis
in
our
mind

they
would
ask
such
thing
as
who
was
smarter
than
the
other

and
they
would
ask
me
whi
i
was

so
differ


i
think
they
felt
that
get
children
into
foster
home
was
a
legitim
pan
of
their
function

and
the
result
would
be
less
troublesom

howev
they
went
about
it

and
when
my
mother
fought
them

they
went
after
her
first

through
me

i
was
the
first
target

i
stole

that
impli
that
i
wasn
t
be
taken
care
of
by
my
mother

all
of
us
were
mischiev
at
some
time
or
anoth

i
more
so
than
ani
of
the
rest

philbert
and
i
kept
a
battl
go

and
this
was
just
one
of
a
dozen
thing
that
kept
build
up
the
pressur
on
my
mother

i
m
not
sure
just
how
or
when
the
idea
was
first
drop
by
the
welfar
worker
that
our
mother
was
lose
her
mind

but
i
can
distinct
rememb
hear

crazi

appli
to
her
by
them
when
they
learn
that
the
negro
fanner
who
was
in
the
next
hous
down
the
road
from
us
had
offer
to
give
us
some
butcher
pork
a
whole
pig

mayb
even
two
of
them
and
she
had
refus

we
all
heard
them
call
my
mother

crazi

to
her
face
for
refus
good
meat

it
meant
noth
to
them
even
when
she
explain
that
we
had
never
eaten
pork

that
it
was
against
her
religion
as
a
seventh
day
adventist

they
were
as
vicious
as
vultur

they
had
no
feel

understand

compass

or
respect
for
my
mother

they
told
us


she
s
crazi
for
refus
food


right
then
was
when
our
home

our
uniti

began
to
disintegr

we
were
have
a
hard
time

and
i
wasn
t
help

but
we
could
have
made
it

we
could
have
stay
togeth

as
bad
as
i
was

as
much
troubl
and
worri
as
i
caus
my
mother

i
love
her

the
state
peopl

we
found
out

had
interview
the
gohanna
famili

andth
gohannas
had
said
that
they
would
take
me
into
their
home

my
mother
threw
a
fit

though

when
she
heard
thatand
the
home
wrecker
took
cover
for
a
while

it
was
about
this
time
that
the
larg

dark
man
from
lans
began
visit

i
don
t
rememb
how
or
where
he
and
my
mother
met

it
may
have
been
through
some
mutual
friend

i
don
t
rememb
what
the
man
s
profess
was

in
1935

in
lans

negro
didn
t
have
anyth
you
could
call
a
profess

but
the
man

big
and
black

look
someth
like
my
father

i
can
rememb
his
name

but
there
s
no
need
to
mention
it

he
was
a
singl
man

and
my
mother
was
a
widow
onli
thirti
six
year
old

the
man
was
independ

natur
she
admir
that

she
was
have
a
hard
time
disciplin
us

and
a
big
man
s
presenc
alon
would
help

and
if
she
had
a
man
to
provid

it
would
send
the
state
peopl
away
forev

we
all
understood
without
ever
say
much
about
it

or
at
least
we
had
no
object

we
took
it
in
stride

even
with
some
amus
among
us

that
when
the
man
came

our
mother
would
be
all
dress
up
in
the
best
that
she
had
she
still
was
a
good
look
woman
and
she
would
act
differ

light
heart
and
laugh

as
we
hadn
t
seen
her
act
in
year

it
went
on
for
about
a
year

i
guess

and
then

about
1936

or
1937

the
man
from
lans
jilt
my
mother
sudden

he
just
stop
come
to
see
her

from
what
i
later
understood

he
final
back
away
from
take
on
the
respons
of
those
eight
mouth
to
feed

he
was
afraid
of
so
mani
of
us

to
this
day

i
can
see
the
trap
that
mother
was
in

saddl
with
all
of
us

and
i
can
also
understand
whi
he
would
shun
take
on
such
a
tremend
respons

but
it
was
a
terribl
shock
to
her

it
was
the
begin
of
the
end
of
realiti
for
my
mother

when
she
began
to
sit
around
and
walk
around
talk
to
herself
almost
as
though
she
was
unawar
that
we
were
there
it
becam
increas
terrifi

the
state
peopl
saw
her
weaken

that
was
when
they
began
the
definit
step
to
take
me
away
from
home

they
began
to
tell
me
how
nice
it
was
go
to
be
at
the
gohannas

home

where
the
gohannas
and
big
boy
and
mrs

adcock
had
all
said
how
much
they
like
me

and
would
like
to
have
me
live
with
them

i

a
feel
of

his
hernia
condit

and
who

and
more

she
gradual
becam
less
respons
to

and
less

we
began
to
be
more
unkempt

and
usual

now

hilda
cook

we
children
watch
our
anchor
give
way

it
was
someth
terribl
that
you
couldn
t
get
your
hand
on

yet
you
couldn
t
get
away
from

it
was
a
sens
that
someth
bad
was
go
to
happen

we
younger
one
lean
more
and
more
heavili
on
the
relat
strength
of
wilfr
and
hilda

who
were
the
oldest

when
final
i
was
sent
to
the
gohannas

home

at
least
in
a
surfac
way
i
was
glad

i
rememb
that
when
i
left
home
with
the
state
man

my
mother
said
one
thing


don
t
let
them
feed
him
ani
pig


it
was
better

in
a
lot
of
way

at
the
gohannas


big
boy
and
i
share
his
roomtogeth

and
we
hit
it
off
nice

he
just
wasn
t
the
same
as
my
blood
brother

the
gohannas
were
veri
religi
peopl

big
boy
and
i
attend
church
with
them

they
were
sanctifi
holi
roller
now

the
preacher
and
congreg
jump
even
higher
and
shout
even
louder
than
the
baptist
i
had
known

they
sang
at
the
top
of
their
lung

and
sway
back
and
forth
and
cri
and
moan
and
beat
on
tambourin
and
chant

it
was
spooki

with
ghost
and
spiritu
and

ha
nts

seem
to
be
in
the
veri
atmospher
when
final
we
all
came
out
of
the
church

go
back
home

the
gohannas
and
mrs

adcock
love
to
go
fish

and
some
saturday
big
boy
and
i
would
go
along

i
had
chang
school
now

to
lans
s
west
junior
high
school

it
was
right
in
the
heart
of
the
negro
communiti

and
a
few
white
kid
were
there

but
big
boy
didn
t
mix
much
with
ani
of
our
schoolmat

and
i
didn
t
either

and
when
we
went
fish

neither
he
nor
i
like
the
idea
of
just
sit
and
wait
for
the
fish
to
jerk
the
cork
under
the
water
or
make
the
tight
line
quiver

when
we
fish
that
way

i
figur
there
should
be
some
smarter
way
to
get
the
fishthough
we
never
discov
what
it
might
be

mr

gohanna
was
close
croni
with
some
other
men
who

some
saturday

would
take
me
and
big
boy
with
them
hunt
rabbit

i
had
my
father
s

22
calib
rifl

my
mother
had
said
it
was
all
right
for
me
to
take
it
with
me

the
old
men
had
a
set
rabbit
hunt
strategi
that
they
had
alway
use

usualli
when
a
dog
jump
a
rabbit

and
the
rabbit
get
away

that
rabbit
will
alway
somehow
instinct
run
in
a
circl
and
return
sooner
or
later
past
the
veri
spot
where
he
origin
was
jump

well

the
old
men
would
just
sit
and
wait
in
hide
somewher
for
the
rabbit
to
come
back

then
get
their
shot
at
him

i
got
to
think
about
it

and
final
i
thought
of
a
plan

i
would
separ
from
them
and
big
boy
and
i
would
go
to
a
point
where
i
figur
that
the
rabbit

return

would
have
to
pass
me
first

it
work
like
magic

i
began
to
get
three
and
four
rabbit
befor
they
got
one

the
astonish
thing
was
that
none
of
the
old
men
ever
figur
out
whi

they
outdid
themselv
exclaim
what
a
sure
shot
i
was

i
was
about
twelv

then

all
i
had
done
was
to
improv
on
their
strategi

and
it
was
the
begin
of
a
veri
import
lesson
in
life
that
anytim
you
find
someon
more
success
than
you
are

especi
when
you
re
both
engag
in
the
same
busi
you
know
they
re
do
someth
that
you
aren
t

i
would
return
home
to
visit
fair
often

sometim
big
boy
and
one
or
anoth

or
both

of
the
gohannas
would
go
with
me
sometim
not

i
would
be
glad
when
some
of
them
did
go

becaus
it
made
the
ordeal
easier

soon
the
state
peopl
were
make
plan
to
take
over
all
of
my
mother
s
children

she
talk
to
herself
near
all
of
the
time
now

and
there
was
a
crowd
of
new
white
peopl
enter
the
picturealway
ask
question

they
would
even
visit
me
at
the
gohannas


they
would
ask
me
question
out
on
the
porch

or
sit
out
in
their
car

eventual
my
mother
suffer
a
complet
breakdown

and
the
court
order
were
final
sign

they
took
her
to
the
state
mental
hospit
at
kalamazoo

it
was
seventi
some

hour
and
a

legal

modern
slaveri
howev

my
mother
remain
in
the
same
hospit
at
kalamazoo
for
about
twenti
sixyear

later

when
i
was
still
grow
up
in
michigan

i
would
go
to
visit
her
everi
so
often

noth
that
i
can
imagin
could
have
move
me
as
deepli
as
see
her
piti
state

in
1963

we
got
my
mother
out
of
the
hospit

and
she
now
live
there
in
lans
with
philbert
and
his
famili

it
was
so
much
wors
than
if
it
had
been
a
physic
sick

for
which
a
caus
might
be
known

medicin
given

a
cure
effect

everi
time
i
visit
her

when
final
they
led
her
a
case

a
number
back
insid
from
where
we
had
been
sit
togeth

i
felt
wors

my
last
visit

when
i
knew
i
would
never
come
to
see
her
again
there
was
in
1952

i
was
twentyseven

my
brother
philbert
had
told
me
that
on
his
last
visit

she
had
recogn
him
somewhat


in
spot


he
said

but
she
didn
t
recogn
me
at
all

she
stare
at
me

she
didn
t
know
who
i
was

her
mind

when
i
tri
to
talk

to
reach
her

was
somewher
els

i
ask


mama

do
you
know
what
day
it
is


she
said

stare


all
the
peopl
have
gone


i
can
t
describ
how
i
felt

the
woman
who
had
brought
me
into
the
world

and
nurs
me

and
advis
me

and
chastis
me

and
love
me

didn
t
know
me

it
was
as
if
i
was
tri
to
walk
up
the
side
of
a
hill
of
feather

i
look
at
her

i
listen
to
her

talk


but
there
was
noth
i
could
do

i
truli
believ
that
if
ever
a
state
social
agenc
destroy
a
famili

it
destroy
our

we
want
and
tri
to
stay
togeth

our
home
didn
t
have
to
be
destroy

but
the
welfar

the
court

and
their
doctor

gave
us
theon
two
three
punch

and
our
was
not
the
onli
case
of
this
kind

i
knew
i
wouldn
t
be
back
to
see
my
mother
again
becaus
it
could
make
me
a
veri
vicious
and
danger
person
know
how
they
had
look
at
us
as
number
and
as
a
case
in
their
book

not
as
human
be

and
know
that
my
mother
in
there
was
a
statist
that
didn
t
have
to
be

that
exist
becaus
of
a
societi
s
failur

hypocrisi

greed

and
lack
of
merci
and
compass

henc
i
have
no
merci
or
compass
in
me
for
a
societi
that
will
crush
peopl

and
then
penal
them
for
not
be
abl
to
stand
up
under
the
weight

i
have
rare
talk
to
anyon
about
my
mother

for
i
believ
that
i
am
capabl
of
kill
a
person

without
hesit

who
happen
to
make
the
wrong
kind
of
remark
about
my
mother

so
i
purpos
don
t
make
ani
open
for
some
fool
to
step
into

back
then
when
our
famili
was
destroy

in
1937

wilfr
and
hilda
were
old
enough
so
that
the

with
the
greatest
celebr
of

pride
our
generat
had
ever
known

everi
negro
boy
old
enough
to

want
to
be
the
next
brown

my
brother
philbert

who
had
alreadi
becom
a
pretti
good
boxer
in
school

was
no
except


i
was
tri
to
play
basketbal

i
was
gangl
and
tall

but
i
wasn
t
veri
good
at
it
too
awkward


in
the
fall
of
that
year

philbert
enter
the
amateur
bout
that
were
held
in
lans
s
prudden
auditorium

he
did
well

surviv
the
increas
tough
elimin

i
would
go
down
to
the
gym
and
watch
him
train

it
was
veri
excit

perhap
without
realiz
it
i
becam
secret
envious

for
one
thing

i
know
i
could
not
help
see
some
of
my
younger
brother
reginald
s
lifelong
admir
for
me
get
siphon
off
to
philbert

peopl
prais
philbert
as
a
natur
boxer

i
figur
that
sinc
we
belong
to
the
same
famili

mayb
i
would
becom
one

too

so
i
put
myself
in
the
ring

i
think
i
was
thirteen
when
i
sign
up
for
my
first
bout

but
my
height
and
rawbon
frame
let
me
get
away
with
claim
that
i
was
sixteen

the
minimum
age
and
my
weight
of
about
128
pound
got
me
classifi
as
a
bantamweight

they
match
me
with
a
white
boy

a
novic
like
myself

name
bill
peterson

i
ll
never
forget
him

when
our
turn
in
the
next
amateur
bout
came
up

all
of
my
brother
and
sister
were
24
there
watch

along
with
just
about
everyon
els
i
knew
in
town

they
were
there
not
so
much
becaus
of
me
but
becaus
of
philbert

who
had
begun
to
build
up
a
pretti
good
follow

and
they
want
to
see
how
his
brother
would
do

i
walk
down
the
aisl
between
the
peopl
throng
the
row
of
seat

and
climb
in
the
ring

bill
peterson
and
i
were
introduc

and
then
the
refere
call
us
togeth
and
mumbl
all
of
that
stuff
about
fight
fair
and
break
clean

then
the
bell
rang
and
we
came
out
of
our
corner

i
knew
i
was
scare

but
i
didn
t
know

as
bill
peterson
told
me
later
on

that
he
was
scare
of
me

too

he
was
so
scare
i
was
go
to
hurt
him
that
he
knock
me
down
fifti
time
if
he
did
onc

he
did
such
a
job
on
my
reput
in
the
negro
neighborhood
that
i
practic
went
into
hide

a
negro
just
can
t
be
whip
by
somebodi
white
and
return
with
his
head
up
to
the
neighborhood

especi
in
those
day

when
sport
and

to
a
lesser
extent
show
busi

were
the
onli
field
open
to
negro

and
when
the
ring
was
the
onli
place
a
negro
could
whip
a
white
man
and
not
be
lynch

when
i
did
show
my
face
again

the
negro
i
knew
rode
me
so
bad
i
knew
i
had
to
do
someth

but
the
worst
of
my
humili
was
my
younger
brother
reginald
s
attitud

he
simpli
never
mention
the
fight

it
was
the
way
he
look
at
me
and
avoid
look
at
me

so
i
went
back
to
the
gym

and
i
train
hard

i
beat
bag
and
skip
rope
and
grunt
and
sweat
all
over
the
place

and
final
i
sign
up
to
fight
bill
peterson
again

this
time

the
bout
were
held
in
his
hometown
of
alma

michigan

the
onli
thing
better
about
the
rematch
was
that
hard
anyon
i
knew
was
there
to
see
it

i
was
particular
grate
for
reginald
s
absenc

the
moment
the
bell
rang

i
saw
a
fist

then
the
canva
come
up

and
ten
second
later
the
refere
was
say

ten


over
me

it
was
probabl
the
shortest

fight

in
histori

i
lay
there
listen
to
the
full
count

but
i
couldn
t
move

to
tell
the
truth

i
m
not
sure
i
want
to
move

that
white
boy
was
the
begin
and
the
end
of
my
fight
career

a
lot
oftun
in
these
later
year
sinc
i
becam
a
muslim

i
ve
thought
back
to
that
fight
and
reflect
that
it
was
allah
s
work
to
stop
me

i
might
have
wound
up
punchi

not
long
after
this

i
came
into
a
classroom
with
my
hat
on

i
did
it
deliber

the
teacher

who
was
white

order
me
to
keep
the
hat
on

and
to
walk
around
and
around
the
room
until
he
told
me
to
stop


that
way


he
said


everyon
can
see
you

meanwhil

we
ll
go
on
with
class
for
those
who
are
here
to
learn
someth


i
was
still
walk
around
when
he
got
up
from
his
desk
and
turn
to
the
blackboard
to
write
someth
on
it

everyon
in
the
classroom
was
look
when

at
this
moment

i
pass
behind
his
desk

snatch
up
a
thumbtack
and
deposit
it
in
his
chair

when
he
turn
to
sit
back
down

i
was
far
from
the
scene
of
the
crime

circl
around
the
rear
of
the
room

then
he
hit
the
tack

and
i
heard
him
holler
and
caught
a
glimps
of
him
spraddl
up
as
i
disappear
through
the
door

with
my
deport
record

i
wasn
t
realli
shock
when
the
decis
came
that
i
had
been
expel

i
guess
i
must
have
had
some
vagu
idea
that
if
i
didn
t
have
to
go
to
school

i
d
be
allow
to
stay
on
with
the
gohannas
and
wander
around
town

or
mayb
get
a
job
if
i
want
one
for
pocket
money

but
i
got
rock
on
my
heel
when
a
state
man
whom
i
hadn
t
seen
befor
came
and
got
me
at
the
gohannas

and
took
me
down
to
court

they
told
me
i
was
go
to
go
to
a
reform
school

i
was
still
thirteen
year
old

but
first
i
was

to
the
detent

on
their
way

wait
for
their
hear

the
white
state

was
a
mr

allen

he
was
nicer
to
me
than

of
the
state
welfar
peopl
had
been

he
even
had
consol
word
for
the
gohannas

els

but
he

there
at

on
the
weekend
with

i
notic
again
how
white
peopl
smell
differ
from
us

and
how
their
food
tast
differ

not
season
like
negro
cook

i
began
to
sweep
and
mop
and
dust
around
in
the
swerlin

hous

as
i
had
done
with
big
boy
at
the
gohannas


they
all
like
my
attitud

and
it
was
out
of
their
like
for
me
that
i
soon
becam
accept
by
them
as
a
mascot

i
know
now

they
would
talk
about
anyth
and
everyth
with
me
stand
right
there
hear
them

the
same
way
peopl
would
talk
freeli
in
front
of
a
pet
canari

they
would
even
talk
about
me

or
about

nigger


as
though
i
wasn
t
there

as
if
i
wouldn
t
understand
what
the
word
meant

a
hundr
time
a
day

they
use
the
word

nigger


i
suppos
that
in
their
own
mind

they
meant
no
harm

in
fact
they
probabl
meant
well

it
was
the
same
with
the
cook

lucill

and
her
husband

duan

i
rememb
one
day
when
mr

swerlin

as
nice
as
he
was

came
in
from
lans

where
he
had
been
through
the
negro
section

and
said
to
mrs

swerlin
right
in
front
of
me


i
just
can
t
see
how
those
nigger
can
be
so
happi
and
be
so
poor


he
talk
about
how
they
live
in
shack

but
had
those
big

shine
car
out
front

and
mrs

swerlin
said

me
stand
right
there


nigger
are
just
that
way








that
scene
alway
stay
with
me

it
was
the
same
with
the
other
white
peopl

most
of
them
local
politician

when
they
would
come
visit
the
swerlin

one
of
their
favorit
parlor
topic
was

nigger


one
of
them
was
the
judg
who
was
in
charg
of
me
in
lans

he
was
a
close
friend
of
the
swerlin

he
would
ask
about
me
when
he
came

and
they
would
call
me
in

and
he
would
look
me
up
and
down

his
express
approv

like
he
was
examin
a
fine
colt

or
a
pedigre
pup

i
knew
they
must
have
told
him
how
i
act
and
how
i
work

what
i
am
tri
to
say
is
that
it
just
never
dawn
upon
them
that
i
could
understand

that
i
wasn
t
a
pet

but
a
human
be

they
didn
t
give
me
credit
for
have
the
same
sensit

intellect

and
understand
that
they
would
have
been
readi
and
will
to
recogn
in
a
white
boy
in
my
posit

but
it
has
histor
been
the
case
with
white
peopl

in
their
regard
for
black
peopl

that
even
though
we
might
be
_with_
them

we
weren
t
consid
of
them

even
though
they
appear
to
have
open
the
door

it
was
still
close

thus
they
never
did
realli
see
_me_

this
is
the
sort
of
kind
condescens
which
i
tri
to
clarifi
today

to
these
integr
hungri
negro

about
their

liber

white
friend

these
so
call

good
white
peopl

most
of
them
anyway

i
don
t
care
how
nice
one
is
to
you

the
thing
you
must
alway
rememb
is
that
almost
never
doe
he
realli
see
you
as
he
see
himself

as
he
see
his
own
kind

he
may
stand
with
you
through
thin

but
not
thick

when
the
chip
are
down

you
ll
find
that
as
fix
in
him
as
his
bone
structur
is
his
sometim
subconsci
convict
that
he
s
better
than
anybodi
black

but
i
was
no
more
than
vagu
awar
of
anyth
like
that
in
my
detent
home
year

i
did
my
littl
chore
around
the
hous

and
everyth
was
fine

and
each
weekend

they
didn
t
mind
my
catch
a
ride
over
to
lans
for
the
afternoon
or
even

if
i
wasn
t
old
enough

i
sure
was
big
enough
by
then

and
nobodi
ever
question
my
hang
out

even
at
night

in
the
street
of
the
negro
section

i
was
grow
up
to
be
even
bigger
than
wilfr
and
philbert

who
had
begunto
meet
girl
at
the
school
danc

and
other
place

and
introduc
me
to
a
few

but
the
one
who
seem
to
like
me

i
didn
t
go
for
and
vice
versa

i
couldn
t
danc
a
lick

anyway

and
i
couldn
t
see
squander
my
few
dime
on
girl

so
most
i
pleasur
myself
these
saturday
night
by
gawk
around
the
negro

who
bore
the
magic
name

new

which
is
how
i
first
heard
lucki
thompson
and
milt
jackson

both
of
whom
i
later
got
to
know
well
in
harlem

mani
youngster
from
the
detent
home

when
their
date
came
up

went
off
to
the
reform
school

but
when
mine
came
up
two
or
three
time
it
was
alway
ignor

i
saw
new
youngster
arriv
and
leav

i
was
glad
and
grate

i
knew
it
was
mrs

swerlin
s
do

i
didn
t
want
to
leav

she
final
told
me
one
day
that
i
was
go
to
be
enter
in
mason
junior
high
school

it
was
the
onli
school
in
town

no
ward
of
the
detent
home
had
ever
gone
to
school
there

at
least
while
still
a
ward

so
i
enter
their
seventh
grade

the
onli
other
negro
there
were
some
of
the
lyon
children

younger
than
i
was

in
the
lower
grade

the
lyons
and
i

as
it
happen

were
the
town
s
onli
negro

they
were

as
negro

veri
much
respect

mr

lyon
was
a
smart

hardwork
man

and
mrs

lyon
was
a
veri
good
woman

she
and
my
mother

i
had
heard
my
mother
say

were
two
of
the
four
west
indian
in
that
whole
section
of
michigan

some
of
the
white
kid
at
school

i
found

were
even
friendlier
than
some
of
those
in
lans
had
been

though
some

includ
the
teacher

call
me

nigger


it
was
easi
to
see
that
they
didn
t
mean
ani
more
harm
by
it
than
the
swerlin

as
the

nigger

of
my
class

i
was
in
tact
extrem
popular
i
supposepart
becaus
i
was
kind
of
a
novelti

i
was
in
demand

i
had
top
prioriti

but
i
also
benefit
from
the
special
prestig
of
have
the
seal
of
approv
from
that
veri
important
woman
about
the
town
of
mason

mrs

swerlin

nobodi
in
mason
would
have
dream
of
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
her

it
becam
hard
for
me
to
get
through
a
school
day
without
someon
after
me
to
join
this
or
head
up
that
the
debat
societi

the
junior
high
basketbal
team

or
some
other
extracurricular
activ

i
never
turn
them
down

and
i
hadn
t
been
in
the
school
long
when
mrs

swerlin

know
i
could
use
spend
money
of
my
own

got
me
a
job
after
school
wash
the
dish
in
a
local
restaur

my
boss
there
was
the
father
of
a
white
classmat
whom
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
with

his
famili
live
over
the
restaur

it
was
fine
work
there

everi
friday
night
when
i
got
paid

i
d
feel
at
least
ten
feet
tall

i
forget
how
much
i
made

but
it
seem
like
a
lot

it
was
the
first
time
i
d
ever
had
ani
money
to
speak
of

all
my
own

in
my
whole
life

as
soon
as
i
could
afford
it

i
bought
a
green
suit
and
some
shoe

and
at
school
i
d
buy
treat
for
the
other
in
my
class
at
least
as
much
as
ani
of
them
did
for
me

english
and
histori
were
the
subject
i
like
most

my
english
teacher

i
recal
a
mr

ostrowskiwa
alway
give
advic
about
how
to
becom
someth
in
life

the
one
thing
i
didn
t
like
about
histori
class
was
that
the
teacher

mr

william

was
a
great
one
for

nigger

joke

one
day
dure
my
first
week
at
school

i
walk
into
the
room
and
he
start
sing
to
the
class

as
a
joke



way
down
yonder
in
the
cotton
field

some
folk
say
that
a
nigger
won
t
steal


veri
funni

i
like
histori

but
i
never
thereaft
had
much
like
for
mr

william

later

i
rememb

we
came
to
the
textbook
section
on
negro
histori

it
was
exact
one
paragraph
long

mr

william
laugh
through
it
practic
in
a
singl
breath

read
aloud
how
the
negro
had
been
slave
and
then
were
freed

and
how
they
were
usual
lazi
and
dumb
and
shiftless

he
ad

i
rememb

an
anthropolog
footnot
on
his
own

tell
us
between
laugh
how
negro

feet
were

so
big
that
when
they
walk

theydon
t
leav
track

they
leav
a
hole
in
the
ground


i
m
sorri
to
say
that
the
subject
i
most
dislik
was
mathemat

i
have
thought
about
it

i
think
the
reason
was
that
mathemat
leav
no
room
for
argument

if
you
made
a
mistak

that
was
all
there
was
to
it

basketbal
was
a
big
thing
in
my
life

though

i
was
on
the
team

we
travel
to
neighbor
town
such
as
howel
and
charlott

and
wherev
i
show
my
face

the
audienc
in
the
gymnasium

nigger

and

coon

me
to
death

or
call
me

rastus


it
didn
t
bother
my
teammat
or
my
coach
at
all

and
to
tell
the
truth

it
bother
me
onli
vagu

mine
was
the
same
psycholog
that
make
negro
even
today

though
it
bother
them
down
insid

keep
let
the
white
man
tell
them
how
much

progress

they
are
make

they
ve
heard
it
so
much
they
ve
almost
gotten
brainwash
into
believ
it
or
at
least
accept
it

after
the
basketbal
game

there
would
usual
be
a
school
danc

whenev
our
team
walk
into
anoth
school
s
gym
for
the
danc

with
me
among
them

i
could
feel
the
freez

it
would
start
to
eas
as
they
saw
that
i
didn
t
tri
to
mix

but
stuck
close
to
someon
on
our
team

or
kept
to
myself

i
think
i
develop
way
to
do
it
without
make
it
obvious

even
at
our
own
school

i
could
sens
it
almost
as
a
physic
barrier

that
despit
all
the
beam
and
smile

the
mascot
wasn
t
suppos
to
danc
with
ani
of
the
white
girl

it
was
some
kind
of
psychic
messag
not
just
from
them

but
also
from
within
myself

i
am
proud
to
be
abl
to
say
that
much
for
myself

at
least

i
would
just
stand
around
and
smile
and
talk
and
drink
punch
and
eat
sandwich

and
then
i
would
make
some
excus
and
get
away
earli

they
were
typic
small
town
school
danc

sometim
a
littl
white
band
from
lans
would
be
brought
in
to
play

but
most
often

the
music
was
a
phonograph
set
up
on
a
tabl

with
the
volum
turn
up
high

and
the
record
scratchi

blare
thing
like
glenn
miller
s

moonlight
serenad

his
band
was
ride
high
then
or
the
ink
spot

who
were
also
veri
popular

sing

if
i
didn
t
care


i
use
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
think
about
a
peculiar
thing

mani
of
these
mason
white
boy

like
the
one
at
the
lans
school
especi
if
they
knew
me
well

and
if
we
hung
out
a
lot
togetherwould
get
me
off
in
a
corner
somewher
and
push
me
to
proposit
certain
white
girl

sometim
their
own
sister

they
would
tell
me
that
they
d
alreadi
had
the
girl
themselvesinclud
their
sister
or
that
they
were
tri
to
and
couldn
t

later
on

i
came
to
understand
what
was
go
on

if
they
could
get
the
girl
into
the
posit
of
have
broken
the
terribl
taboo
by
slip
off
with
me
somewher

they
would
have
that
hammer
over
the
girl

head

to
make
them
give
in
to
them

it
seem
that
the
white
boy
felt
that
i

be
a
negro

just
natur
knew
more
about

romanc


or
sex

than
they
did
that
i
instinct
knew
more
about
what
to
do
and
say
with
their
own
girl

i
never
did
tell
anybodi
that
i
realli
went
for
some
of
the
white
girl

and
some
of
them
went
for
me

too

they
let
me
know
in
mani
way

but
anytim
we
found
ourselv
in
ani
close
convers
or
potenti
intim
situat

alway
there
would
come
up
between
us
some
kind
of
a
wall

the
girl
i
realli
want
to
have
were
a
coupl
of
negro
girl
whom
wilfr
or
philbert
had
introduc
me
to
in
lans

but
with
these
girl

somehow

i
lack
the
nerv

from
what
i
heard
and
saw
on
the
saturday
night
i
spent
hang
around
in
the
negro
district
i
knew
that
race
mix
went
on
in
lans

but
strang
enough

this
didn
t
have
ani
kind
of
effect
on
me

everi
negro
in
lans

i
guess

knew
how
white
men
would
drive
along
certain
street
in
the
black
neighborhood
and
pick
up
negro
streetwalk
who
patrol
the
area

and

on
the
other
hand

there
was
a
bridg
that
separ
the
negro
and
polishneighborhood

where
white
women
would
drive
or
walk
across
and
pick
up
negro
men

who
would
hang
around
in
certain
place
close
to
the
bridg

wait
for
them

lans
s
white
women

even
in
those
day

were
famous
for
chase
negro
men

i
didn
t
yet
appreci
how
most
white
accord
to
the
negro
this
reput
for
prodigi
sexual
prowess

there
in
lans

i
never
heard
of
ani
troubl
about
this
mix

from
either
side

i
imagin
that
everyon
simpli
took
it
for
grant

as
i
did

anyway

by
then

i

_proud_
of

mrs

exclaim
when
she
heard
about
my
elect

it
was
all
over
the
restaur
where
i
work

even
the
state

maynard
allen

who
still
drop
by
to
see
me
onc
in
a
while

had
a
word
of
prais

he
said
he
never
saw
anybodi
prove
better
exact
what

reform

meant

i
realli
like
him
except
for
one
thing

he
now
and
then
would
drop
someth
that
hint
my
mother
had
let
us
down
somehow

fair
often

i
would
go
and
visit
the
lyons

and
they
act
as
happi
as
though
i
was
one
of
their
children

and
it
was
the
same
warm
feel
when
i
went
into
lans
to
visit
my
brother
and
sister

and
the
gohannas

i
rememb
one
thing
that
mar
this
time
for
me

the
movi

gone
with
the
wind


when
it
play
in
mason

i
was
the
onli
negro
in
the
theater

and
when
butterfli
mcqueen
went
into
her
act

i
felt
like
crawl
under
the
rug

everi
saturday

just
about

i
would
go
into
lans

i
was
go
on
fourteen

now

wilfr
and
hilda
still
live
out
by
themselv
at
the
old
famili
home

hilda
kept
the
hous
veri
clean

it
was
easier
than
my
mother
s
plight

with
eight
of
us
alway
underfoot
or
run
around

wilfr
work
wherev
he
could

and
he
still
read
everi
book
he
could
get
his
hand
on

philbert
was
get
a
reput
as
one
of
the
better
amateur
fighter
in
this
part
of
the
state

everyon
realli
expect
that
he
was
go
to
becom
a
profession

reginald
and
i

after
my
fight
fiasco

had
final
gotten
back
on
good
term

it
made
me
feel
great
to
visit
him
and
wesley
over
at
mrs

william


i
d
offhand
give
them
each
a
coupl
of
dollar
to
just
stick
in
their
pocket

to
have
someth
to
spend

and
littl
yvonn
and
robert
were
do
okay

too

over
at
the
home
of
the
west
indian
ladi

mrs

mcguir

i
d
give
them
about
a
quarter
apiec

it
made
me
feel
good
to
see
how
they
were
come
along

none
of
us
talk
much
about
our
mother

and
we
never
mention
our
father

i
guess
none
of
us
knew
what
to
say

we
didn
t
want
anybodi
els
to
mention
our
mother
either

i
think

from
time
to
time

though

we
would
all
go
over
to
kalamazoo
to
visit
her

most
often
we
older
one
went
singl

for
it
was
someth
you
didn
t
want
to
have
to
experi
with
anyon
els
present

even
your
brother
or
sister

dure
this
period

the
visit
to
my
mother
that
i
most
rememb
was
toward
the
end
of
that
seventh
grade
year

when
our
father
s
grown
daughter
by
his
first
marriag

ella

came
from
boston
to
visit
us

wilfr
and
hilda
had
exchang
some
letter
with
ella

and
i

at
hilda
s
suggest

had
written
to
her
from
theswerlin


we
were
all
excit
and
happi
when
her
letter
told
us
that
she
was
come
to
lans

i
think
the
major
impact
of
ella
s
arriv

at
least
upon
me

was
that
she
was
the
first
realli
proud
black
woman
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life

she
was
plain
proud
of
her
veri
dark
skin

this
was
unheard
of
among
negro
in
those
day

especi
in
lans

i
hadn
t
been
sure
just
what
day
she
would
come

and
then
one
afternoon
i
got
home
from
school
and
there
she
was

she
hug
me

stood
me
away

look
me
up
and
down

a
command
woman

mayb
even
bigger
than
mrs

swerlin

ella
wasn
t
just
black

but
like
our
father

she
was
jet
black

the
way
she
sat

move

talk

did
everyth

bespok
somebodi
who
did
and
got
exact
what
she
want

this
was
the
woman
my
father
had
boast
of
so
often
for
have
brought
so
mani
of
their
famili
out
of
georgia
to
boston

she
own
some
properti

he
would
say

and
she
was

in
societi


she
had
come
north
with
noth

and
she
had
work
and
save
and
had
invest
in
properti
that
she
built
up
in
valu

and
then
she
start
send
money
to
georgia
for
anoth
sister

brother

cousin

niec
or
nephew
to
come
north
to
boston

all
that
i
had
heard
was
reflect
in
ella
s
appear
and
bear

i
had
never
been
so
impress
with
anybodi

she
was
in
her
second
marriag

her
first
husband
had
been
a
doctor

ella
ask
all
kind
of
question
about
how
i
was
do

she
had
alreadi
heard
from
wilfr
and
hilda
about
my
elect
as
class
presid

she
ask
especi
about
my
grade

and
i
ran
and
got
my
report
card

was
then
one
of
the
three
highest
in
the
class

ella
prais
me

her
about
her

help
up
other


we
littl

ella
said

it
thrill
me
to
hear
her
say
that

and
even
more

the
way
she
said
it

i
had
becom
a
mascot

our
branch
of
the
famili
was
split
to
piec

i
had
just
about
forgotten
about

said
that

all
of
us
littl
in
lans
accompani
her
on
a

and
come
back

it

made
a
strike
contrast

black
one
hug
each
other

i
don
t
rememb
much
about
the
rest
of
the
visit

except
that
there
was
a
lot
of
talk

and
ella
had
everyth
in
hand

and
we
left
with
all
of
us
feel
better
than
we
ever
had
about
the
circumst

i
know
that
for
the
first
time

i
felt
as
though
i
had
visit
with
someon

had
some
kind
of
physic
ill
that
had
just
linger
on

a
few

restless
with

and
for

first
time
in
my
life
a
restless
with
be
around
white
peopl
began
as
soon
as
i
got
back
home
and
enter
eighth
grade

i
continu
to
think
constant
about
all
that
i
had
seen
in
boston

and
about
the
way
i
had
felt
there

i
know
now
that
it
was
the
sens
of
be
a
real
part
of
a
mass
of
my
own
kind

for
the
first
time

the
white
peopl
classmat

the
swerlin

the
peopl
at
the
restaur
where
i
work
notic
the
chang

they
said


you
re
act
so
strang

you
don
t
seem
like
yourself

malcolm

what
s
the
matter


i
kept
close
to
the
top
of
the
class

though

the
topmost
scholast
stand

i
rememb

kept
shift
between
me

a
girl
name
audrey
slaugh

and
a
boy
name
jimmi
cotton

it
went
on
that
way

as
i
becam
increas
restless
and
disturb
through
the
first
semest

and
then
one
day

just
about
when
those
of
us
who
had
pass
were
about
to
move
up
to
8
a

from
which
we
would
enter
high
school
the
next
year

someth
happen
which
was
to
becom
the
first
major
turn
point
of
my
life

somehow

i
happen
to
be
alon
in
the
classroom
with
mr

ostrowski

my
english
teacher

he
was
a
tall

rather
reddish
white
man
and
he
had
a
thick
mustach

i
had
gotten
some
of
my
best
mark
under
him

and
he
had
alway
made
me
feel
that
he
like
me

he
was

as
i
have
mention

a
natur
born

advisor


about
what
you
ought
to
read

to
do

or
think
about
ani
and
everyth

we
use
to
make
unkind
joke
about
him

whi
was
he
teach
in
mason
instead
of
somewher
els

get
for
himself
some
of
the

success
in
life

that
he
kept
tell
us
how
to
get

i
know
that
he
probabl
meant
well
in
what
he
happen
to
advis
me
that
day

i
doubt
that
he
meant
ani
harm

it
was
just
in
his
natur
as
an
american
white
man

i
was
one
of
his
top
student

one
of
the
school
s
top
student
but
all
he
could
see
for
me
was
the
kind
of
futur

in
your
place

that
almost
all
white
peopl
see
for
black
peopl

he
told
me


malcolm

you
ought
to
be
think
about
a
career

have
you
been
give
it
thought


the
truth
is

i
hadn
t

i
never
have
figur
out
whi
i
told
him


well

i
ve
been
think
i
d
like
to
be
a
lawyer


lans
certain
had
no
negro
lawyer
or
doctor
either
in
those
day

to
hold
up
an
imag
i
might
have
aspir
to

all
i
realli
knew
for
certain
was
that
a
lawyer
didn
t
wash
dish

as
i
was
do

mr

ostrowski
look
surpris

i
rememb

and
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
clasp
his
hand
behind
his
head

he
kind
of
half
smile
and
said


malcolm

one
of
life
s
first
need
is
for
us
to
be
realist

don
t
misunderstand
me

now

we
all
here
like
you

you
know
that

but
you
ve
got
to
be
realist
about
be
a
nigger

a
lawyer
that
s
no
realist
goal
for
a
nigger

you
need
to
think
about
someth
you
_can_
be

you
re
good
with
your
hand
make
thing

everybodi
admir
your
carpentri
shop

whi
don
t
you
plan
on
carpentri

peopl
like
you
as
a
person
you
d
get
all
kind
of
work


the
more
i
thought
afterward
about
what
he
said

the
more
uneasi
it
made
me

it
just
kept
tread
around
in
my
mind

what
made
it
realli
begin
to
disturb
me
was
mr

ostrowski
s
advic
to
other
in
my
class
all
of
them
white

most
of
them
had
told
him
they
were
plan
to
becom
farmer

but
those
who
want
to
strike
out
on
their
own

to
tri
someth
new

he
had
encourag

some

most
girl

want
to
be
teacher

a
few
want
other
profess

such
as
one
boy
who
want
to
becom
a
counti
agent

anoth

a
veterinarian

and
one
girl
want
to
be
a
nurs

they
all
report
that
mr

ostrowski
had
encourag
what
they
had
want

yet
near
none
of
them
had
earn
mark
equal
to
mine

it
was
a
surpris
thing
that
i
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way
befor

but
i
realiz
that
whatev
i
wasn
t

i
_was_
smarter
than
near
all
of
those
white
kid

but
appar
i
was
still
not
intellig
enough

in
their
eye

to
becom
whatev
_i_
want
to
be

it
was
then
that
i
began
to
chang
insid

i
drew
away
from
white
peopl

i
came
to
class

and
i
answer
when
call
upon

it
becam
a
physic
strain
simpli
to
sit
in
mr

ostrowski
s

their
face
that
someth
was
about

told
me
that
none
of
them
could
understand
whi
after
i
had
done
so
well
in

and
on
my
job

and
live
with
them

and
after
everyon

had
come
to
like
me
i
had
late
begun
to
make
them
all
feel
that
i
wasn
t
happi
there
anymor

she
said
she
felt
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
stay
at
the
o
detent
home
ani
longer

and
that
arrang
had
been
made
for
me
to
go
and
live
with
the
lyon
famili

who
like
me
so
much

she
stood
up
and
put
out
her
hand


i
guess
i
ve
ask
you
a
hundr
time

malcolm
do
you
want
to
tell
me
what
s
wrong


i
shook
her
hand

and
said


noth

mrs

swerlin


then
i
went
and
got
my
thing

and
came
back
down

at
the
live
room
door
i
saw
her
wipe
her
eye

i
felt
veri
bad

i
thank
her
and
went
out
in
front
to
mr

allen

who
took
me
over
to
the
lyon


mr

and
mrs

lyon

and
their
children

dure
the
two
month
i
live
with
them
while
finish
eighth
grade
also
tri
to
get
me
to
tell
them
what
was
wrong

but
somehow
i
couldn
t
tell
them

either

i
went
everi
saturday
to
see
my
brother
and
sister
in
lans

and
almost
everi
other
day
i
wrote
to
ella
in
boston

not
say
whi

i
told
ella
that
i
want
to
come
there
and
live

i
don
t
know
how
she
did
it

but
she
arrang
for
offici
custodi
of
me
to
be
transfer
from
michigan
to
massachusett

and
the
veri
week
i
finish
the
eighth
grade

i
again
board
the
greyhound
bus
for
boston

i
ve
thought
about
that
time
a
lot
sinc
then

no
physic
move
in
my
life
has
been
more
pivot
or
profound
in
it
repercuss

if
i
had
stay
on
in
michigan

i
would
probabl
have
marri
one
of
those
negro
girl
i
knew
and
like
in
lans

i
might
have
becom
one
of
those
state
capitol
build
shoeshin
boy

or
a
lans
countri
club
waiter

or
gotten
one
of
the
other
menial
job
which

in
those
day

among
lans
negro

would
have
been
consid

success

or
even
becom
a
carpent

whatev
i
have
done
sinc
then

i
have
driven
myself
to
becom
a
success
at
it

i
ve
often
thought
that
if
mr

ostrowski
had
encourag
me
to
becom
a
lawyer

i
would
today
probabl
be
among
some
citi
s
profession
black
bourgeoisi

sip
cocktail
and
palm
myself
off
as
a
communiti
spokesman
for
and
leader
of
the
suffer
black
mass

while
my
primari
concern
would
be
to
grab
a
few
more
crumb
from
the
groan
board
of
the
two
face
white
with
whom
they
re
beg
to

integr


all
prais
is
due
to
allah
that
i
went
to
boston
when
i
did

if
i
hadn
t

i
d
probabl
still
be
a
brainwash

written
all
over

my
appear
was
too
much
for
even
ella

but
she
told
me
later
she
had
seen
countrifi
member
of
the
littl
famili
come
up
from

in
even
wors
shape
than

was

ella
had
fix
up
a
nice
littl
upstair
room
for
me

and
she
was
truli
a
georgia
negro
woman
when
she
got
into
the
kitchen
with
her
pot
and
pan

she
was
the
kind
of
cook
who
would
heap
up
your
plate
with
such
as
ham
hock

green

black

pea

fri
fish

cabbag

sweet

grit
and

and
the
more
you
put
away
the
better
she
felt

i
work
out
at
ella
s
kitchen
tabl
like
there
was
no
tomorrow

ella
still
seem
to
be
as
big

black

outspoken
and
impress
a
woman
as
she
had
been
in
mason
and
lans

onli
about
two
week
befor
i
arriv

she
had
split
up
with
her
second
husband
the
soldier

frank

whom
i
had
met
there
the
previous
summer

but
she
was
take
it
right
in
stride

i
could
see

though
i
didn
t
say

how
ani
averag
man
would
find
it
almost
imposs
to
live
for
veri
long
with
a
woman
whose
everi
instinct
was
to
run
everyth
and
everybodi
she
had
anyth
to
do
with
includ
me

about
my
second
day
there
in
roxburi

ella
told
me
that
she
didn
t
want
me
to
start
hunt
for
a
job
right
away

like
most
newcom
negro
did

she
said
that
she
had
told
all
those
she
dbrought
north
to
take
their
time

to
walk
around

to
travel
the
buse
and
the
subway

and
get
the
feel
of
boston

befor
they
tie
themselv
down
work
somewher

becaus
they
would
never
again
have
the
time
to
realli
see
and
get
to
know
anyth
about
the
citi
they
were
live
in

ella
said
she
d
help
me
find
a
job
when
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
to
work

so
i
went
gawk
around
the
neighborhood
the
waumbeck
and
humboldt
avenu
hill
section
of
roxburi

which
is
someth
like
harlem
s
sugar
hill

where
i
d
later
live

i
saw
those
roxburi
negro
act
and
live
differ
from
ani
black
peopl
i
d
ever
dream
of
in
my
life

this
was
the
snooti
black
neighborhood

they
call
themselv
the

four
hundr


and
look
down
their
nose
at
the
negro
of
the
black
ghetto

or
so
call

town

section
where
mari

my
other
half
sister

live

what
i
thought
i
was
see
there
in
roxburi
were
high
class

educ

import
negro

live
well

work
in
big
job
and
posit

their
quiet
home
sat
back
in
their
mow
yard

these
negro
walk
along
the
sidewalk
look
haughti
and
dignifi

on
their
way
to
work

to
shop

to
visit

to
church

i
know
now

of
cours

that
what
i
was
realli
see
was
onli
a
big
citi
version
of
those

success

negro
bootblack
and
janitor
back
in
lans

the
onli
differ
was
that
the
one
in
boston
had
been
brainwash
even
more
thorough

they
pride
themselv
on
be
incompar
more

cultur



cultiv



dignifi


and
better
off
than
their
black
brethren
down
in
the
ghetto

which
was
no
further
away
than
you
could
throw
a
rock

under
the
piti
misapprehens
that
it
would
make
them

better


these
hill
negro
were
break
their
back
tri
to
imit
white
peopl

ani
black
famili
that
had
been
around
boston
long
enough
to
own
the
home
they
live
in
was
consid
among
the
hill
elit

it
didn
t
make
ani
differ
that
they
had
to
rent
out
room
to
make
end
meet

then
the
nativ
born
new
englander
among
them
look
down
upon
recent
migrat
southernhom
owner
who
live
next
door

like
ella

and
a
big
percentag
of
the
hill
dweller
were
in
ella
s
categori
southern
striver
and
scrambler

and
west
indian
negro

whom
both
the
new
englander
and
the
southern
call

black

usualli
it
was
the
southern

the

who
not
onli
manag

but
also
at

they
rent
as

the

own
less

act

stride
around
as
if

i

who
talk
so
affect
among

that

i
don

me
how
so

then
and
now

could
stand
the
indign
of
that
kind
of

and
began
to

walk
as
far
as

another
day

i
took

subway
ride

when
most
of
the

follow

it
was
cambridg

and
i
circl
all
around
in

have
told
me

forum
some
twenti
year
later

i
also
did
a
lot
of
explor
downtown

whi
a
citi
would
have
two
big
railroad
station
north
station
and
south
station
i
couldn
t
understand

at
both
of
the
station

i
stood
around
and
watch
peopl
arriv
and
leav

and
i
did
the
same
thing
at
the
bus
station
where
ella
had
met
me

my
wander
even
led
me
down
along
the
pier
and
dock
where
i
read
plaqu
tell
about
the
old
sail
ship
that
use
to
put
into
port
there

in
a
letter
to
wilfr

hilda

philbert

and
reginald
back
in
lans

i
told
them
about
all
this

and
about
the
wind

narrow

cobbleston
street

and
the
hous
that
jam
up
against
each
other

downtown
boston

i
wrote
them

had
the
biggest
store
i
d
ever
seen

and
white
peopl
s
restaur
and
hotel

i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
go
to
see
everi
movi
that
came
to
the
fine

air
condit
theater

on
massachusett
avenu

next
door
to
one
of
them

the
loew
s
state
theater

was
the
huge

excit
roseland
state
ballroom

big
poster
out
in
front
advertis
the
nation
famous
band

white
and
negro

that
had
play
there


coming
next
week


when
i
went
by
that
first
time

was
glenn
miller

i
rememb
think
how
near
the
whole
even
s
music
at
mason
high
school
danc
had
been
glenn
miller
s
record

what
wouldn
t
that
crowdhav
given

i
wonder

to
be
stand
where
glenn
miller
s
band
was
actual
go
to
play

i
didn
t
know
how
familiar
with
roseland
i
was
go
to
becom

ella
began
to
grow
concern

becaus
even
when
i
had
final
had
enough
sight
see

i
didn
t
stick
around
veri
much
on
the
hill

she
kept
drop
hint
that
i
ought
to
mingl
with
the

nice
young
peopl
my
age

who
were
to
be
seen
in
the
townsend
drugstor
two
block
from
her
hous

and
a
coupl
of
other
place

but
even
befor
i
came
to
boston

i
had
alway
felt
and
act
toward
anyon
my
age
as
if
they
were
in
the

kid

class

like
my
younger
brother
reginald

they
had
alway
look
up
to
me
as
if
i
were
consider
older

on
weekend
back
in
lans
where
i
d
go
to
get
away
from
the
white
peopl
in
mason

i
d
hung
around
in
the
negro
part
of
town
with
wilfr
s
and
philbert
s
set

though
all
of
them
were
sever
year
older
than
me

i
was
bigger

and
i
actual
look
older
than
most
of
them

i
didn
t
want
to
disappoint
or
upset
ella

but
despit
her
advic

i
began
go
down
into
the
town
ghetto
section

that
world
of
groceri
store

walk
up
flat

cheap
restaur

poolroom

bar

storefront
church

and
pawnshop
seem
to
hold
a
natur
lure
for
me

not
onli
was
this
part
of
roxburi
much
more
excit

but
i
felt
more
relax
among
negro
who
were
be
their
natur
selv
and
not
put
on
air

even
though
i
did
live
on
the
hill

my
instinct
were
never
and
still
aren
t
to
feel
myself
better
than
ani
other
negro

i
spent
the
first
month
in
town
with
my
mouth
hang
open

the
sharp
dress
young

cat

who
hung
on
the
comer
and
in
the
poolroom

bar
and
restaur

and
who
obvious
didn
t
work
anywher

complet
entranc
me

i
couldn
t
get
over
marvel
at
how
their
hair
was
straight
and
shini
like
white
men
s
hair

ella
told
me
this
was
call
a

conk


i
had
nevertast
a
sip
of
liquor

never
even
smoke
a
cigarett

and
here
i
saw
littl
black
children

ten
and
twelv
year
old

shoot
crap

play
card

fight

get
grown
up
to
put
a
penni
or
a
nickel
on
their
number
for
them

thing
like
that

and
these
children
threw
around
swear
word
i
d
never
heard
befor

even

and
slang
express
that
were
just
as
new
to
me

such
as

stud

and

cat

and

chick

and

cool

and

hip


everi
night
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
turn
these
new
word
over
in
my
mind

it
was
shock
to
me
that
in
town

especi
after
dark

you
d
occasion
see
a
white
girl
and
a
negro
man
stroll
arm
in
arm
along
the
sidewalk

and
mix
coupl
drink
in
the
neonlight
bar
not
slip
off
to
some
dark
corner

as
in
lans

i
wrote
wilfr
and
philbert
about
that

too

i
want
to
find
a
job
myself

to
surpris
ella

one
afternoon

someth
told
me
to
go
insid
a
poolroom
whose
window
i
was
look
through

i
had
look
through
that
window
mani
time

i
wasn
t
yearn
to
play
pool

in
fact

i
had
never
held
a
cue
stick

but
i
was
drawn
by
the
sight
of
the
cool
look

cat

stand
around
insid

bend
over
the
big

green

felt
top
tabl

make
bet
and
shoot
the
bright
color
ball
into
the
hole

as
i
stare
through
the
window
this
particular
afternoon

someth
made
me
decid
to
ventur
insid
and
talk
to
a
dark

stubbi

conk
head
fellow
who
rack
up
ball
for
the
pool
player

whom
i
d
heard
call

shorti


one
day
he
had
come
outsid
and
seen
me
stand
there
and
said

hi

red


so
that
made
me
figur
he
was
friend

as
inconspicu
as
i
could

i
slip
insid
the
door
and
around
the
side
of
the
poolroom

avoid
peopl

and
on
to
the

on

was
this
thick

smooth
sheen
of
shine
red
hair
real
red
as
straight
as
ani
white

s

how
ridicul
i
was

stupid

in

i
vow
that
i
d
never
again
be
without
a
conk

and
i
never
was
for
mani
year

this
was
my
first
realli
big
step
toward
self
degrad

when
i
endur
all
of
that
pain

liter
burn
my
flesh
to
have
it
look
like
a
white
man
s
hair

i
had
join
that
multitud
of
negro
men
and
women
in
america
who
are
brainwash
into
believ
that
the
black
peopl
are

inferior

and
white
peopl
superior

that
they
will
even
violat
and
mutil
their
god
creat
bodi
to
tri
to
look

pretti

by
white
standard

look
around
today

in
everi
small
town
and
big
citi

from
two
bit
catfish
and
soda
pop
joint
into
the

integr

lobbi
of
the
waldorf
astoria

and
you
ll
see
conk
on
black
men

and
you
ll
see
black
women
wear
these
green
and
pink
and
purpl
and
red
and
platinum
blond
wig

they
re
all
more
ridicul
than
a
slapstick
comedi

it
make
you
wonder
if
the
negro
has
complet
lost
his
sens
of
ident

lost
touch
with
himself

you
ll
see
the
conk
worn
by
mani

mani
so
call

upper
class

negro

and

as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
it
about
them

on
all
too
mani
negro
entertain

one
of
the
reason
that
i
ve
especi
admir
some
of
them

like
lionel
hampton
and
sidney
poiter

among
other

is
that
they
have
kept
their
natur
hair
and
fought
to
the
top

i
admir
ani
negro
man
who
has
never
had
himself
conk

or
who
has
had
the
sens
to
get
rid
of
it
as
i
final
did

i
don
t
know
which
kind
of
self
defac
conk
is
the
greater
shame
the
one
you
ll
see
on
the
head
of
the
black
so
call

middl
class

and

upper
class


who
ought
to
know
better

or
the
one
you
ll
see
on
the
head
of
the
poorest

most
downtrodden

ignor
black
men

i
mean
the
legal
minimum
wage
ghetto
dwell
kind
of
negro

as
i
was
when
i
got
my
first
one

it
s
general
among
these
poor
fool
that
you
ll
see
a
black
kerchief
over
the
man
s
head

like
aunt
jemima

he
s
tri
to
make
his
conk
last
longer

between
trip
to
the
barbershop

onli
for
special
occas
is
this
kerchief
protect
conk
expos
to
show
off
how

sharp

and

hip

it
owner
is

the
iron
thing
is
that
i
have
never
heard
ani
woman

white
or
black

express
ani
admir
for
a
conk

of
cours

ani
white
woman
with
a
black
man
isn
t
think
about
his
hair

but
i
don
t
see
how
on
earth
a
black
woman
with
ani
race
pride
could
walk
down
the
street
with
ani
black
man
wear
a
conk
the
emblem
of
his
shame
that
he
is
black

to
my
own
shame

when
i
say
all
of
this
i
m
talk
first
of
all
about
myself
becaus
you
can
t
show
me
ani
negro
who
ever
conk
more
faith
than
i
did

i
m
speak
from
person
experi
when
i
say
of
ani
black
man
who
conk
today

or
ani
white
wig
black
woman

that
if
they
gave
the
brain
in
their
head
just
half
as
much
attent
as
they
do
their
hair

they
would
be
a
thousand
time
better
off
